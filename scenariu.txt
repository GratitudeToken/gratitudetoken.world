In order to understand BiiP which stands for Biospheric Internet Identity Protocol, I have to answer the most important question any human can ask in life:

Children often think about it...
The question is, Who am I?

Am I the name that I was given?
Am I the sex that I was born with?
Am I my job or my ocupation?

Asian or Indian kids don't think about this question very much because in their culture, they already know the right answer.
Unlike kids that were raised by western parents or that went through a western educational system.
They already know, from a very young age...
that they are the land...
they are the oceans...
they are the air...
they are the plants and the animals...
they are all the elements that make up the universe.

In a religious sense, they are taught that they are God.

You may think: What does this have to do with BiiP?

Here I will talk about the difference between our usual straw man identity that is serving the government and the new Biospheric Internet identity.
