Hey you!

What brought you here?
The wind? The sea?
A little bird?
Maybe it's the music in your soul.

Anyway, I'm glad you're here with me.
Wanna know some secrets?

Alrighty then.

The animated effects on the homepage are never exactly the same.

Just like they say no snowflake is alike.

For each page load or reload, the coordinates, speeds and general parameters for each effect are governed by a bit of randomness.

Supernova! Oh yeah, you didn't know by now?
Ever tried a long click on the moving nodes section? I could play with that for hours.

Every visitor is observing slightly different patterns/effects that never repeat themselves and you are the honorable only witness of their exact configuration.

I hope it's not too artsy.
But, I wanted to offer my gratitude for each moment we share together.
We can never get bored when we work for the entire human species.

For example what do you think would happen if you could catch a fire spark?
There are 23 random fire sparks that always change trajectory on page reload or scrolling the page down and up to an extent, if you click/touch the right one, a nice surprise awaits you.
