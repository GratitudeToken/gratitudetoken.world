So please do conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.<br><br><b>What do you get?</b><br>Investing in the Public Presale and IDO means that you are supporting the open-source community at GratitudeToken.world to develop BiiP based technologies and provide better alternatives to the currently established corporate online services that make up the internet.<br>In exchange, being in the very first round of investors, you get the highest potential for high returns on your investment, but even this investment has its risks and it might not pay off immediately after the Public Presale and IDO will end.<br>You might have to wait a long time, anywhere from a few months to a few years to see some financial gains, or if some other force majeure will take place, your investment might lose some of its value.<br>It is our belief, not a guarantee, that the Gratitude Tokens will never lose all of their value and that they will always be valued at a higher price long term by any GRAT market. A considerable amount of your investment will be used to provide liquidity in these markets.<br>If our mission goes well, the financial gains can be very high long term and the internet as we know it will be a thing of the past. 'It will transform from a caterpillar into a butterfly'.<br>The internet is shifting from a pyramid (a 'Social' media 'Echo Chamber') to what it was always destined to be: a unifying Biosphere Media.<br>Our vision for the internet is that it should not be just as a multi-tool for connecting with our fellow humans to share information (art, knowledge, technology, wisdom, etc), but also a tool for empowering everyone equally and uniformly.<br>We need to allow every individual almost 100% retention of value from their interaction with platforms/apps which are using BiiP.<br>We want to live in a world where any human can extract value from BiiP networks, can retain that value, can grow it exponentially and instantly accross all domains and applications.<br>We are ending the cycle of greed, bestowing these rights to everyone, not only to a few people at the top of currently established internet corporations that have monopolized what we call the Internet of today (2022).<br><br><b class='color-white' style='font-size: 32px'>What you need to do:</b><br><span style='font-size: 18px'>Create an account using the WebAuth mobile app and enter the username after clicking the [ I AGREE ] button under the video.<br>This takes around 3 minutes.
