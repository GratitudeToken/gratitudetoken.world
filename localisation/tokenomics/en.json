    "title2": "Step 2 - IDO (Initial DEX Offering)",
    "p2": "Starts on <b style='color: white'>9 December 2022</b> and ends when all the 96 Million tokens + Public Presale reports are sold.<br><br><b>Adaptive IDO</b><br>For any month with reports (tokens that were not aquired by investors) the reported GRAT tokens will be carried to the next month where we will only add a difference up to 8.000.000 tokens. This ensures a uniform distribution accross time. This means that the IDO supply will not exceed more than 8.000.000 GRAT tokens per month, until all 96 million tokens are consumed by investors.<br><br>This semi-automatic emission method is as adaptive as PoW (Proof of Work), but with the major difference, or should we say extra benefit that you don't have to invest in mining hardware / rent / power to receive/mint new tokens. We don't want to harm the Biosphere when you can just invest or register to get and hold GRAT tokens directly.<br><br>Our simple yet effective strategy is enough to not allow 'whales' to gobble up most of the IDO supply and to avoid contributing to the already critical Biosphere Pollution problems. It's very important that we avoid chemical emissions that would have happened with a mining algorithm for minting/emitting the tokens.",
    "title3": "Step 3 - Long term AirDrops",
    "p3": "Starts when the first Genesis Initiative is launched and ends when the last remaining token is airdropped (freely) to registering users of Genesis Iniatives or other projects that implemented our BiiP technology or that is collaborating with the GratitudeToken.world community.",
    "title4": "Price Predictions",
    "p4": "Based on a series of simulations we predict the price will eventually be much higher than the IDO price, due to demand for Gratitude Tokens that will be created by providing real utility through Genesis Initiatives and other projects.<br><br>As users acquire more tokens, we know many of them will exchange it to fiat or other crypto. The pairs (markets) created during and after the IDO will have the price of the tokens dictated by real supply and demand, no fake volumes.<br><br>It is our experience, that listing a crypto coin or token on multiple exchanges is not only unsafe, but also does not provide long term organic growth for the price of a crypto currency or asset. Therefore, we are looking to offer a few safe entry points for investors and not expose our network to many attack vectors through which hackers or fraudulent exchanges can steal your coins.<br><br>To keep the general price of the tokens at a decent level long term, we rely on the prediction that most users that will receive airdrops will need more tokens to be able to fully enjoy the experience Genesis Initiative platforms or apps will provide.<br><br>Due to the limited supply of tokens, there will always be more buy orders than sell orders, ensuring a higher price then the starting price  of the presale or the IDO."
