In exchange, you get the potential for high returns on your investment (more than the people that will invest after the Public Presale and IDO), but even this investment has its risks and it might not pay off immediately after the Public Presale and IDO will end.<br>\r\n                    You might have to wait a long time, anywhere from a few months to a few years to see some financial gains, or if some other force majeure will take place, your investment might lose some of its value.<br>\r\n                    It is our belief, not a guarantee, that the Gratitude Tokens will never lose all of their value and that they will always be valued at a higher price long term by the markets we'll help create.<br>\r\n                    If our mission goes well, the financial gains can be very high long term and the internet as we know it will be a thing of the past. \"It will transform from a caterpillar into a butterfly\".<br>\r\n                    The internet will transform from a pyramid, a \"Social\" media \"Echo Chamber\" to what it was always destined to be, a unifying Biosphere Media. It will not be just as a multi-tool for connecting with our fellow humans to share information (art, knowledge, technology, wisdom, etc), but also a tool for empowering everyone equally and uniformly, enabling every individual almost 100% retention of value from their interaction with platforms/apps which are using BiiP.<br>\r\n                    Thus we are aiming to enable any human to extract value from BiiP networks, to retain that value, to grow it exponentially and instantly accross all domains and applications, as opposed to bestowing these rights to only a few people at the top of currently established internet corporations that have monopolized what we call the Internet of today (2022).\r\n                </p><br><br>\r\n                <h2>CREATE ORDER</h2><br><br>\r\n                <form id=\"order-form\" class=\"grid-1-3\" action=\"?\" method=\"POST\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label for=\"order-username\">Username</label><br>\r\n                        <input id=\"order-username\" type=\"text\" maxlength=\"23\" placeholder=\"your blockchain username\" /><br><br><br>\r\n                        <label for=\"order-amount\">Tokens amount <span class=\"color-gray\">(50.000 limit per order)</span></label><br>\r\n                        <input id=\"order-amount\" type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"50000\" placeholder=\"1\" /><br><br><br>\r\n                        <label for=\"order-email\">Email <span class=\"color-gray\">(will not be made public)</span></label><br>\r\n                        <input id=\"order-email\" type=\"email\" maxlength=\"32\" placeholder=\"your email\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"grid-span2columns\">\r\n                        <label for=\"order-mentions\">Mentions <span class=\"color-gray\">(will not be made public)</span></label><br>\r\n                        <textarea id=\"order-mentions\" maxlength=\"1000\"></textarea><br><br>\r\n                        <div class=\"g-recaptcha\" data-sitekey=\"6Ld-i7khAAAAAIXfJ-dBOJXrgNePcQXgGksi3hoT\"></div><br>\r\n                        <input id=\"terms\" type=\"checkbox\" /> <label for=\"terms\">I agree to the Terms and Conditions above.</label>\r\n                        <input id=\"order-submit\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </form><br><br>\r\n                <h2 style=\"color: lime\">Need help?</h2><br>\r\n                Contact us at <img style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom;\" src=\"/tokenomics/img/support.png\"/>, or message us through the 'Social' Media links in the footer.\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h2 style=\"text-align: center\">EGALITARIAN TOKENOMICS</h2>\r\n                <br>\r\n                <img class=\"img1\" src=\"/tokenomics/img/gratitude-tokenomics.png\"/>\r\n                <br><br><br><br>\r\n                <h2>Step 1 - PUBLIC PRESALE</h2>\r\n                <p>Starts on <span class=\"color-white\">9 September 2022</span> and ends on <span class=\"color-white\">2 December 2022</span>.

This ensures a uniform distribution accross time. This means that the IDO supply will not exceed more than 8.000.000 GRAT tokens per month, until all 96 million tokens are consumed by investors.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                    This semi-automatic emission method is as adaptive as PoW (Proof of Work), but with the major difference, or should we say extra benefit that you don't have to invest in mining hardware / rent / power to receive/mint new tokens. We don't want to harm the Biosphere when you can just invest or register to get and hold GRAT tokens directly.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                    Our simple yet effective strategy is enough to not allow 'whales' to gobble up most of the IDO supply and to avoid contributing to the already critical Biosphere Pollution problems. It's very important that we avoid chemical emissions that would have happened with a mining algorithm for minting/emitting the tokens.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br><br>\r\n                <h2>Step 3 - Long term AirDrops</h2>\r\n                <p>Starts when the first Genesis Initiative is launched and ends when the last remaining token\r\n                is airdropped (freely distributed) to registering users of Genesis Iniatives or other projects\r\n                that implemented our BiiP technology or that is collaborating with the GratitudeToken.world\r\n                community.</p>\r\n                <br><br>\r\n                <h2>Price Predictions</h2>\r\n                <p>Based on a series of simulations we predict the price will eventually be much higher than the\r\n                IDO price, due to demand for Gratitude Tokens that will be created by providing real utility through Genesis Initiatives and other projects.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                As users acquire more tokens, we know many of them will exchange it to fiat or other crypto. The pairs (markets) created during and after the IDO will have the price of the tokens dictated by real supply and demand, no fake volumes.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                It is our experience, that listing a crypto coin or token on multiple exchanges is not only unsafe, but also does not provide long term organic growth for the price of a crypto currency or asset.
