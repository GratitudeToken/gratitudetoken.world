    <b>Hello friends!</b> It's no secret that we, the founders of <strong>GratitudeToken.world</strong> work for the billions of souls living in our indivisible biosphere, and we're not just talking about the human species.
    Our dreams and desires are manifesting through the work on this project. We are here to stay and believe me when I say: <b>A revolution has begun</b>.
    The <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> community aims to transform the way everyone uses the internet by redefining the way we value / appreciate and interact with everything digital online. We dared to imagine a world beyond advertising, a world with very different incentives, a world beyond survival.
    We're focused on open-source development of DApps with real utility, nurturing the shift towards a biospheric internet that will be based on a thought process and/or technology fitting for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5Krh2ZmZkk" target="_blank">biosphere consciousness</a>:

    "Because greed has ran its course, the caterpillars have ate enough and it's time to transform, for tomorrow... we spread our wings and fly."
    You are reading this because one by one, we are all becoming the agents of change that are transforming the internet from a caterpillar into a butterfly.
    One of my favorite humans once said:
    "<i>There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it's going to be a butterfly.</i>" - R. Buckminster Fuller
<img class="fullWidth" style="margin-top: 0.32em" src="/white-paper/img/Buckminster-Fuller-Tensegrity-Sphere.jpg" loading="lazy" />















    Bucky was a brilliant architect, systems theorist, author, designer, inventor and futurist. One of the most important mathematical discoveries he gifted to our species is called <b>Vector Equilibrium</b> - "<i>The vector equilibrium is the zero starting point for happenings or nonhappenings: it is the empty theater and empty circus and empty Universe ready to accommodate any act and any audience</i>". More about it <a href="https://cosmometry.net/vector-equilibrium-&-isotropic-vector-matrix" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">The WWW (World Wide Web)</h2>
    We sometimes see the WWW represented as a üåê spherical network or a network globe, but just like the founding fathers started off America, the internet was founded and expanded by greedy corporations. So, due to the hierarchical nature of corporations, it became a üî∫ pyramid, not a unified üåé biosphere as it was meant to become.
    The WWW is founded from greed and it ignorantly sustains the 6<sup>th</sup> great extinction event. It is time for our species to evolve to a Biosphere Web that connects everything from gratitude to ‚àû infinity.
    You see, the pyramid is a symbol that represents division, as opposed to a biosphere that represents unification or unity. The pyramid is a knife that cuts, it can never be an agent of unification.
    Today, the üî∫ WWW divides the world while the üåé Biosphere Web truly spans across the planet and unifies our world, our biosphere.

<h2 class="heading">The passing of greed</h2>
    I invite you to imagine a world where greed was replaced by gratitude at a societal level and at an online digital level.
    "Among us lives a species named <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=homo+capensis&t=h_&iar=images" target="_blank">„Éõ„É¢„Ç´„Éö„É≥„Ç∑„Çπ</a>, they are similar to caterpillars, they are greedy and predictible. They are descendants from the pharaohs of Egypt, the ones with the elongated heads you have seen in the egyptian hieroglyphs. Their descendants currently rule the monetary systems of the world."

<h2 class="heading">The problems</h2>
    <b>The adoption of the IP (Internet Protocol) connected the world, but did it unify it?</b>
    No, because corporations monopolized and centralized the internet, imprisoning us in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ofWFx525s" target="_blank">Filter Bubbles</a>, killing so much life in their ignorant race to
        </page>
        <page class="page">plunder the biosphere, to get precious resources, to make "even better" tech gadgets to spy us with, so they can keep exploiting the value humans create.
    <b>Did the internet free us all from ignorance?</b>
    No, we are currently facing a global fake news and false information problem that causes cyclical mass psychosis. We are being surveilled 24/7 by paranoid, criminal information agencies. We are scammed by non profit organizations. False threats from viruses and war are popular recurring themes used to keep us in fear.
    <b>Did the internet give everyone equal access to modern online digital services?</b>
    No, half of the world population has limited or no access to internet and those who do have access are manipulated and controlled by surveillance capitalism governments and corporations and the value we create online is mostly transfered to the tip of the pyramid.

    If you want to find out how we can solve these problems, keep reading and find out how we can use technology to serve and celebrate life instead of enslaving and ending it.
    As Jiddu Krishnamurti, one of the greatest thinkers that India has produced often said:

<img class="fullWidth stickBottom" src="/white-paper/img/quote-if-we-can-really-understand-the-problem-the-answer-will-come-out-of-it-because-the-answer-jiddu-krishnamurti.jpg" loading="lazy" />
        </page>
        <page class="page">    We believe technology should serve all lives, not just a small group of humanoids (a greedy cabal that doesn't care about you and me).
    The projects you are just learning about on <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> are very ambitious and we need everyone to join forces with the Gratitude community. Together we can shift our world towards better, wiser technological solutions that serve the majority, not just the elite (the 1%). <b>Freedom should be free</b>.
    <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> is the home of the <b>Biospheric Identity Internet Protocol</b> (BiiP) and a place where we can join the community seeding a Planetary Value Revolution, leaded by the <b>Gratitude Token</b> (GRAT) - a currency of gratitude, created for decentralizing value and finance.
    BiiP & GRAT are meant to become the base for a real second layer Internet Protocol, they're designed to fix the way we use the internet and in consequence, how we distribute the biosphere's energy and resources. We will take back the internet from corporations by creating better alternatives.
    We are focused on unifying technology meant to serve everyone, especially the underserved. BiiP aims to ‚Äúunbank‚Äù the world. It will liberate & empower everyone, not just the 1% (the greedy elite).
    By implementing <strong>BiiP</strong> world first, we are ushering in a new age of decentralized value derived from: personal information, authentication, and universal finance. BiiP will allow us to own our digital self and to provide safer, friendlier, more reliable decentralized online services.
    Our projects represent a powerful effort protected by <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world/license-copyright.html" target="_blank">open-source GPL 3.0 license</a>. Their main objective is to nurture a revolutionary and expansive self-emerging vision, comprised of 6 parts:
    <b>VALUE, DO, GRATITUDE, TECHNOLOGY, GENESIS, SHIELD</b>.
    Currently, on the 2 main indexing and tracking websites for blockchain projects (<a href="http://coinmarketcap.com" target="_blank">coinmarketcap.com</a> and <a href="http://cryptocompare.com" target="_blank">cryptocompare.com</a>) there are over 19 thousand projects listed. Disruptive technology is exploited in early years.
    It is unfortunate that way over 90% of all those projects were created by scammers or people that never really had the intention to use blockchain technology for the benefit of the entire biosphere.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    It's also unfortunate that a lot of rich people exploited and keep exploiting the digital tokens or currency markets created by those projects. These people are called "whales" and market makers.
    To add to the heartache, most if not all centralized exchanges are not playing fair and aren't trying to support any real effort towards a better future for life on this planet.
    Unlike most blockchain technologies or crypto projects that were never created with a benevolent intention in their core, <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> was envisioned to be the opposable force. A place where the open-source community and true blockchain visionaries can come together and build a better future for our species and in consequence, for all life on this planet, for the future of our entire biosphere.

<h2 class="heading">Summary</h2>
    <h3 class="heading">VALUE ‰æ°ÂÄ§</h3> - This part is about really plunging into the word <strong>value</strong> and discussing it in depth.
    We will discuss not only the subjective and objective meaning of the word in different contexts but also the relationships between Value, Human Beings and Money.
    In this chapter, we talk about the idea of money, go through the history of money, and try to find its place in our current paradigm.
    We try to answer questions like:
    <b>Who is responsible for the system?
    Who is accounting for all the money?
    What is inflation?</b>
    Hopefully, these subjects will be understood better after reading this part.
    Everyone should understand why money and the system governing it persisted in our world, therefore, we hope to shed light on one of the most important aspects of our lives that everyone needs to understand if we are ever to set the human species free.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <h3 class="heading">DO Ë¥à„Çã</h3> - This part is about our divine ability to act, to manifest our natural desires, to manifest our most elevated lives through coordinated, consensual collective action.
    We elaborate on how the culture most of us grew up in has not prepared us at all for what we need to DO to create our dream life, our dream world. Rather it educated us on how to be individualistic, autonomous, how to become a lifeless cog in a system of endless survival, work, misery, boredom, and suffering.
    Our peers, the educational system and our entire modern society (the collective) are unfortunately still greatly focused only on working hard for more ‚Äúmoney‚Äù with the purpose to consume everything we discover. This is the behavior of viruses, not of living beings.
    We are indirectly taking profit from the hard work of others, indirectly or unconsciously supporting slavery across the globe, or irreversibly polluting the living Biosphere by adhering to a corrupt monetary system and consumeristic culture. We have no idea about circular production and consumption cycles other than on a superficial level with limited recycling initiatives in a few countries, while the poorest countries (biosphere areas) are transformed into world dumpsters.
    We talk about how we were taught to compete against each other, not to work together and build community; we were not taught to serve others and to elevate ourselves by seeking truth and joy.
    We were taught that Joy comes from materialistic rewards, that superficiality is valuable, that vanity is happiness and that opulence represents power.
    All of that is false, mere illusions, lies, it's a (figurative) house of cards falling as we speak.
    The entire system exists only to slowly indoctrinate us with a singular goal: Struggle hard to get more units of currency or other symbols and fall into the trap of thinking that if we had more money, we could have everything we ever wanted (consumerism).
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <h3 class="heading">GRATITUDE ÊÑüË¨ù</h3> -  In this part, we talk about the meaning of gratitude and offer an introduction to our ambitious project.
    We talk about Gratitude, truly the most amazing discovery you can make in your entire life.
    It's so easy to miss this life-changing state of heart and mind in our 21st century normal.
    Our ‚Äú21st century normal - a fibrillating anxious state from an overactive ego, stemming from a misfiring default mode network which is the auto-biographical mind [‚Ä¶]‚Äù.
    Gratitude allows us to be in perfect clarity and control over every moment of our lives.
    <i>To the grateful eyes, life is wonderful. To the ungrateful eyes, life is misery.</i>

    <h3 class="heading">TECHNOLOGY ÊäÄË°ì</h3> - Here we will talk about the meaning of technology, its current state, and where it's going. We explain how it's nothing but an extension of our thoughts or thinking processes. From a knife to Artificial Intelligence - technology is not good or bad, it's the makers and users of it that create that distinction.
    In this part we introduce <strong>BiiP</strong> as a new global technological standard, a blockchain-based second layer internet protocol.
    We talk about hard 21st century problems, we talk about the technology called "blockchain", about how it's still in its infancy and we introduce our technology and our solutions for a world shifting from greed to gratitude.

    <h3 class="heading">GENESIS ÂÖÉ</h3> - means beginning. In our case, the beginning of the shift to the Biosphere Consciousness Digital Internet.
    Inspired from the infinite torus, the name and logo represent the umbrella of 8 chosen initiatives that will begin and lead the change towards the new Biospheric Internet era. Here we elaborate on our practical vision and the specifics of our ambitious plans.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <h3 class="heading">SHIELD Áõæ</h3> - In this part, we describe our powerful open-source decision-making tool with <strong>NPPoS</strong> (Non-Profit Proof of Stake) membership.
    <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world/shield">SHIELD</a> represents protection through the wisdom of the crowds, the more shield members, the better decisions can be taken for any mission, any cause. Diversity of cognition types and life experience are a quantum key to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akasha" target="_blank">Akasha</a>, a dimension of the Universe where all past/present/future information is stored. I recommend reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds" target="_blank">The wisdom of the crowds</a>.
    SHIELD offers a truly democratic mechanism that will be constantly evolving, it's a way for a community/organisation to express its collective intelligence, taking more precise decisions than any group of experts can. <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world/shield">SHIELD</a> is powered by BiiP and the Gratitude Token.
    <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> will be protected by <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world/shield">SHIELD</a>, a voting solution based on Truth and Collective Value. We will be demonstrating its utility for the first time on this website, the first members will be the founders and co-founders.
    In essence, <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world/shield">SHIELD</a> serves as a public platform where users can stake GRAT tokens to become members and get involved in the development of all <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> projects, including <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world/genesis">Genesis</a> initiatives or projects.

        </page>
        <page class="page">    <strong>VALUE ‰æ°ÂÄ§</strong> - Is a word deeply rooted in our subconscious. As humans, we are constantly redefining the meaning of value, but one truth remains constant: No object and not even our own set of values have any real worth or meaning without other humans involved. We all interpret our meaning of the word value in all areas of life, filtering it through our understanding of all the different experiences and all the knowledge we have accumulated.
    Let's go on a quest to understand the relationships between Value, Human Beings, and Consciousness. On our way, we will deeply understand the idea of money from the past to the present and look forward to the future of money.
    Of course, when we talk about money or assets, we are talking about a specific type of value or utility. Let's start with 2 main attributes of Value that branch out into 2 main categories:
    <strong>1. Subjective Value</strong> - something that has value only to you (one consciousness agent).
    <strong>2. Objective Value</strong> - something that has value for at least 2 consciousness agents (the more people agree on the evaluation, the stronger a consensus is established in a community or a society).

    Objectivity and Subjectivity are rooted even deeper, into our subconscious. Psychologists might argue that it's where the human psyche connects with what the great Carl Jung called the Collective Unconscious, the Soul or Mind of Humanity. The source of all fundamental human archetypes and stereotypes.
    As human beings, we swing between subjectivity and objectivity, especially when we are faced with choices that might provide us with something that we desire.
    Life opportunities should be distributed uniformly/equally. We are all faced with our unique desires for simple things, comfort, experiences, self-worth, self-love, a dreamed life (anything humanely possible of course, we do not
        </page>
        <page class="page"> want to become murderers or worse, politicians).
    Do you also feel that life shouldn't be about debt and working ourselves till death to pay them back?
    Do you also feel that life should be free and beautiful? That life should be magical!?
    To quote Charlie Chaplin from ‚ÄúThe Great Dictator‚Äù:
    <i><b>‚ÄúDo not despair, the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.</b>‚Äù</i>

        <page class="page">    You see, life is magical only for those who dare to dream, and in going forward with this part of our story we will need to be on the same page, in the same boat. Our mission is inclusive.
    To better understand our mission, you must eliminate that version of you that is completely running on a limited program, a script.
    It's over‚Ä¶ let go of that character! Let go of the voice saying: ‚ÄúI'm just surviving, just too poor, just getting by, just can't decide, just can't do things right, just don't know enough, am too old for learning, am not smart enough, am not beautiful enough, am too weak‚Äù.

    There is no room for change in that version of you. Say goodbye, and ‚Ä¶
    <b>Welcome to the New You!</b>
    The You that has everything you ever wanted and is grateful for everything and everyone.
    By adopting this new vibration, attitude, or energy you will ascend to the place where you can fully see and share in our vision.

        </page>
        <page class="page"><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong>, one of the greatest minds of our species, has informed us:

<i><b>‚ÄúTo find the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.‚Äù</b></i>

    Energy, Vibration and Frequency shape our reality, here's an explanation from the great sage & philosophical entertainer <strong>Alan Watts</strong>:

<div class="fullWidth"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LuZ1SqXjLmw" title="It's Already Happening But People Don't See It - Alan Watts on Duality" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>













    Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuZ1SqXjLmw" target="_blank">Alan Watts on Duality</a>

    You see, the new version of you has enough gratitude vibration to access a beautiful abundant life, but only through the lens of gratitude we can see clearly what that life looks like and then we can work towards it.
    Otherwise, we become ungrateful entitled villains in our own life story who only know to harm others to get what they want.
    That is how evil is born. That is the path to ruin, the tragic path.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Money by itself as a symbol is not evil, people are. And without daily gratitude for what we already have, greed will govern the money system.
    Because of this, the whole system becomes evil and we unconsciously become one with it.
    We create a global greed flow that is responsible for stifling progress, suppressing discoveries and innovation, which rewards those who instead support the Status Quo (what has already been established before as valid knowledge or direction).
<img class="fullWidth stickBottom" src="/white-paper/img/game-over.jpg" alt="If we stand up, their little game is over." loading="lazy"/>
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <i><strong>They manipulated us into a real-world monopoly game, and we play against each other with fake fiat money that doesn't represent anything real anymore.</strong></i>
    You see, a money system governed by greed or by inequality is responsible for the economic bubbles that we regularly have, for economic crises and recessions. This system is responsible for destroying the savings, goods and properties of entire families around the world and for most human perpetrated crimes and suicides.
    When economic bubbles burst, global crime rates go up, people are left to fend for themselves. The herd, society, governments do nothing for them.
    If money is unfairly emitted and regulated, which is the case on our planet for the last century, and some might argue for millennia, then it creates inequality of opportunity and it enslaves everyone participating in that system. That's a system where the game is rigged against the players and its makers are not participating, they are outside of it.
    So ‚Ä¶ we find ourselves in a world where people work for money, not for each other. Living on a ‚ÄúMoney Planet‚Äù as it were. But who made this system? Did we humans make it so unfair?
    <b>Why does everyone work for obtaining something called money?
    And why do we pay each other with it to survive and create, to experience human life, yet somehow, we all get poorer and poorer?</b>
    To be alive should be free, or at least fair.
    <b>Has it ever occurred to you that we are ignorantly participating in a very old, but now a global size scam?</b> We will talk about this more later on.
    This took the world many decades to process, but more and more people are now aware of this gruesome crime against humanity.
    Those who create the money and regulate the money are outside the scam, they currently have in place a system where they can just create money out of nothing.
    This is not a joke. The system they created and enforced upon our world is called Fractional Reserve Banking, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money" target="_blank">fiat money</a>.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    In other words, they have unlimited amounts of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù flowing to them without working for it and we must work our entire lives just to be able to pay for a house to live in, or to feed and clothe ourselves.

    <b>Isn't this just slavery, but with extra steps?
    Time to wake up friends!</b>
    As humans we crave to get at least a few hours to live our lives every day, to enjoy life, and maybe some time to think about our life, to put things in perspective, to think about where we are and where we want to be, asking questions, following our curiosity, exploring our reality.
    We should all remember this simple truth: living or enjoying life is the only way for us to thrive, it's what gives us the energy to keep going with our life.

    <b>Did we forget about our spirit?
    Are we really living or enjoying life?</b>
    It's not possible to live while we are subjugated to this corrupt fiat monetary system. Having to spend our energy and time most of each day on a useless and boring job where in exchange we are rewarded with a form of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù worth less and less that will never be enough to survive, let alone to thrive.
    We spend our life (our most precious gift, our time & energy) impulsively chasing fiat money.
    Meanwhile, the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù running the show are playing God with the whole world, ignorantly degrading us and the entire Biosphere in the process.
    But a better alternative is already here, we called it GRAT (short for Gratitude) and its goal is to replace greed with gratitude (to balance out the 1% vs 99% gap).
    Now, that we've spoken a little bit about human value in a Fiat world, let's go back to the origins of money or currency and try to understand the history of money, otherwise, we are doomed to repeat the past and fall in the same traps in the future.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <h2 class="heading">A brief history of money</h2>

<img src="/white-paper/img/barter.jpg" alt="barter primitive man trade" loading="lazy"/>
<strong class="centered">9000 B.C</strong>
    In the beginning, gift economies and barter were the only way of making transactions.
    Back then, humans were limited to the goods that other nearby humans could provide or that travelers could provide.
    There was no consensus to use any small precious objects that would be accepted by a large enough number of humans.
    Goods and services were very limited at that specific time in our history because collective knowledge and technology were very primitive.
    Even today, in villages and other types of communities, people trade their goods or services, sometimes for free, with no intermediaries.
    On the internet, we can see this still taking place on classified-type websites where people trade their goods, assets, and services.
    As kingdoms, empires, and societies developed and expanded people were looking to adopt a better system to represent the value of goods and services, something that could be universally accepted as a good fit, a logical choice meeting the following characteristics or qualities:
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <i>&bull; precious (due to the level of difficulty in obtaining it from the Earth, so it must be a scarce resource or material).
    &bull; non-perishable (it must last basically forever).
    &bull; fungible (it can be traded for another unit/object of the same form/material/size/type).
    &bull; divisible (you can divide it or trade it for smaller parts/units).
    &bull; versatile (having at least a few uses in different arts, crafts, or technological processes, creating long term-value appreciation as new use cases are always discovered for versatile materials like precious metals and stones, thus creating constant demand).</i>
    
    All these characteristics were met in different degrees by different materials like copper, silver, gold, precious stones, etc.
    Eventually, small objects that best met these qualities became a sensible choice for early societies to keep value long term, especially because they were easier to carry and keep safe compared to actual large commodities that could become an easy target for thieves.

    With time, the banking elite's parasitic inflationary fiat system was silently enforced everywhere, replacing deflationary systems around the world.
    ‚ÄúThe United States had been on a "de facto" gold standard since the 1830s and "de jure" gold standard since 1900. In 1913 the gold standard was built into the framework of the Federal Reserve which is a private company. The law required the Federal Reserve to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the currency it issued (technically termed the Federal Reserve Note but colloquially called the dollar) and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price of ‚Ç¨20.67 per ounce of pure gold.‚Äù
    After this, the Federal Reserve was authorized by the government to be the sole printer of U.S dollars and whenever the U.S would need more cash in circulation it would borrow printed dollars from the Federal Reserve and had to pay them back with interest (mind-blowing, I know).

        <page class="page">    This shows the power these bankers have, such that they managed to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù a country like the U.S to give control of the money supply to them. The Federal Reserve is a private company.

Today, the same bankers are everywhere, just under different names. Banks and pharmacies are the most omnipresent entities in our cities and communities.
    The main objective of the bankers was to implement the exact same fiat system globally, so they would be the sole keepers of the global money printing process, and not only that, but their mission was also to put the whole world in debt, and they succeeded.

<h2 class="heading">Modern money mechanics</h2>
    So today, according to the manual entitled <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Modern_Money_Mechanics.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Modern Money Mechanics</b></a> created by the Federal Reserve, banks can create money out of thin air, they are allowed to offer credits in value of up to 9 times they borrow from the government.
    <b>Where does money come from?</b>
    When the government wanted to print more money to increase the circulating supply, it did not give the money directly to the people, instead, it gave it to the banks to inject into the economy by offering loans to private individuals and companies.
    This system not only created inflation but also a lot of interest - money that will never exist in circulation and that will instead slowly push the entire monetary supply into the wallets of the bankers.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Every time this cycle is complete, they have to print more money, creating inflation. In other words, the purchasing power of the currency decreases. And so, all dollars are worth less and less over time (the value of the national currency constantly depreciates over time and this system is active everywhere, in almost all countries).

    When a bank borrows money from the government (let's say 1 million dollars) it gains the right give up to 9 million dollars in credits out of thin air (yeah just like that, numbers on paper before, numbers in a database now). Hard to believe right? Well, did you read the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Modern_Money_Mechanics.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Modern Money Mechanics</b></a> I mentioned before? (You can click the underlined texts; those are links to webpages).

    So, the bank lends for example 1 million dollars to someone out of thin air because they have that 1 million dollars bond secured from the government, but that printed million comes with an amount of interest attached to it (we all know interest, right?). In other words, a number of dollars that will never exist, so the borrower cannot pay back the loan + interest unless he works harder to chip some currency from others.

    The government gets small interest chips from the banks to pay back what they borrowed from the Federal Reserve, then the banks chip 9 times more from us + interest. But the Federal Reserve owns the Banks too. They are a single global entity.
    <b>Do you get it now? Do you see the size of the global hoax?</b>
    You see, working harder should make you richer, but it doesn't, it makes the bankers richer. In living by or participating in this system you are just a slave, a vehicle that carries money from other people to the bankers.

    <b>Do you really want to continue living like this when there is a better way to govern your money?</b>
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Keep reading to learn how to avoid the traps of greedy bankers and become a participant in a system that is deflationary, not inflationary. And that's only the beginning.
    Now, within their fiat system, everyone that borrows money from banks is perpetually enslaved by the debt they must pay back. It's only because money is sort of always in circulation that borrowers can pay back the loan amount plus the interest, spending their life to pay it back.
    The ones that accumulate most of the money supply of their nation over time are the ones who created the money supply (the same people that gave you the loan and created the virtual debt in the first place).
    In their rigged game, they get richer every day and everyone else keeps getting poorer, including governments.
    Banks were supposed to be intermediaries responsible for keeping your deposited money safe, but today, money deposited in a bank is money that you lend to them with no actual benefit.
    On the contrary, today the interest rates, meaning the gains that you were supposed to benefit from by lending money to banks are negative. In other words, you pay to lend money to the banks, but when they lend money to you, you agree to pay back an extra 50%, 100%, 200%, or more of the loaned amount, depending on the type of loan you agree to. Crazy right?
    At one point in history, lending people money with interest was illegal and severely punished. To lend money with interest was and is the job of loan sharks. The only difference is that banks are legal. This illegal practice was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury" target="_blank">usury</a>.
    As for keeping everyone's money safe, banks never met this objective either as other types of thieves would always rob them. To this day, banks are robbed and hacked, and they could care less about the money they lose because they are usually insured by government agencies (by your money) and they never lose. Only we the people lose. Is that fair? When are we going to wake up from this 1% vs 99% hoax? How long are we going to put up with these thieves and villains?
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">Markets</h2>
    There are many markets in the world where people can be creators, producers, consumers, or investors.
    One market is about houses, one is about cars, there are food markets, goods markets, materials markets, education markets, research markets, services markets, tools markets, technology markets, software markets‚Ä¶ etc.
    We have a market for anything humans produce and consume.
    Markets can be about physical things, services, or information.
    Now, online exchanges or brokers are all about serving us technological tools that enable us to gamble or bet easier on the movement of markets (tools for ‚Äúspeculation‚Äù).
    But those movements are not based on reality, they're artificial.
    They are not directly correlated to the demand for any real physical resource, asset, or service.
    Crypto exchanges are just writing software services that tax people's ignorance and aversion to taking unnecessary risks. They cannot be trusted for trading or storing large amounts of currency long term, we have wallet apps that can do that safely now, or simply writing your crypto address and keys with a pen on paper will do.

<h3 class="heading">Being unexperienced</h3>
    99% of all players lose all their money eventually by trading them on brokers or exchanges.
    The reality of exchanges and brokers is that they are the only ones making constant profits by taking a commission for every deposit, exchange, trade, and withdrawal.
    Big players also known as ‚Äúwhales‚Äù also make tons of money by manipulating the markets with unbelievable amounts of liquidity at their disposal. In crypto markets, this is seen as crazy volatility by most people,
        </page>
        <page class="page">but those who educated themselves in this regard know that it's not the right explanation for what actually happens.
    The cause of that volatility is: <i>whales accumulating and dumping crypto currencies like they are doing with every other market.</i>
    Some of those whales are the Exchanges themselves. Again, they cannot be trusted.
    This causes traders to lose their positions and eventually lose all the money they deposited.
    I must say it again: <b>Exchanges should be used only for EXCHANGING!</b>

<h3 class="heading">Being smart</h3>
    So, now that we understand what exchanges are for, let's talk about smart and experienced people that only invest in currencies or assets long term. They are not in the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù of opening trade positions with leverage (a factor of multiplication for risk/reward).
    Smart investors are people that will eventually have more value from their currency or assets they invested in, due to appreciation of the currency/asset over time. In other words, according to the new market consensus that will exist in a few years, or should I say the new demand, the currency or asset has now doubled, tripled, or multiplied its price many times over.
    This is why we often hear the phrase "Bitcoin is better than gold".
    Leaving your cryptocurrency untouched for a few years in a safe wallet is a typical investment scenario where you HOLD onto your cryptocurrency and only withdraw (exchange it) into another currency to buy/get something for yourself to enjoy (a product, tools, cars, real estate, etc).
    Although you can exchange your cryptocurrency and tokens for fiat money, many sellers nowadays accept the most common cryptocurrencies as valid forms of payment, so exchanging to fiat is not needed in many cases nowadays.
    You simply transfer your crypto from your wallet to theirs using simple mobile crypto wallet apps.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    I cannot underline this enough. Exchanges should not be used for gambling, they should be used for what they were created, for currency exchange.
    You should only need an exchange when you want to convert your assets from one currency to another and then you need to store that currency or asset long-term in your own wallet where you control the keys to the account/address.
    You should not keep your money in the exchange wallet/address just as you don't keep your paper money in any physical exchange location after you've made an exchange (like with any street Fiat Currency Exchange).
    Exchanging/swapping currencies can be well used for informed investments (storing of value in a deflationary system with at least one proven revolutionary utility or characteristic) or for charity, as non-profit organizations or initiatives don't have to account for that money and don't have to pay taxes that only sustain a corrupt system.
    Exchanging currencies should be done for:
    ‚Ä¢	Payment of services, products, or information.
    ‚Ä¢	Investing in projects, groups, organizations (including GRAT token).
    ‚Ä¢	Donating or crowd-funding the objectives, activities, or initiatives of individuals, groups, or organizations.

<h2 class="heading">Inflation</h2>
    In all these markets, we witness a cyclical process called inflation.
    <b>Why is the economy running on an inflationary model?
    What or who is responsible for this system? Is it natural? Is it man-made?</b>
    The answer is: It's <b><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=homo+capensis&t=h_&iar=images" target="_blank">„Éõ„É¢„Ç´„Éö„É≥„Ç∑„Çπ</a></b> made, or at least it was started by them and maintained by their descendants. They are responsible for inflation and the bubbles in all markets. They are responsible for taking away our collective power, for denying our awakening and evolution through a well-organized suppression of our unification and uniformization of human collective energy. But this project is not about them.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Our mission at <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> is to take back our life, our energy, our progress as a species. We need to get more for our energy spent. We need a fairer model of return of value for energy spent. We need to stop allowing this group to siphon away all our energy.
    <b>We want every being on mother Terra to dread less and DO more, LIVE more.</b> Here's a chart on the evolution of global inflation since 1920:

<img class="fullWidth" style="margin-top: -0.69em" src="/white-paper/img/global-inflation-since-1920.jpg" alt="global inflation since 1920" loading="lazy"/>















    Inflation is created because an elite banking group of individuals with origins going back to ancient times is currently in control of our monetary systems around the world. Those systems are called fiat money systems.
    In essence, after many decades of resistance by the founding fathers of America (fair to say of which many were also criminals), a secretive elite group has succeeded through assassinations, manipulation, and bribes to obtain the right to ‚Äúprint‚Äù money from nothing in the year of 1913 when the private Federal Reserve company was founded.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    They could from that point in time print money and loan the printed money to the government and banks. Money that is not backed by anything, no resources, no services, no information, nothing but our ignorance and fears. That is when they created the ‚Äúmonopoly game‚Äù and started siphoning away power from all the people.
    But apparently, as a collective, we don't even know who they are.
    You probably never heard of them. You probably thought that the governments are responsible for printing our money. Well, that was true in the past for some periods of time. Unfortunately, today that is completely false and it's not a secret, it's public information.
    This endless printing of money/currency, today named by them as Quantitative Easing (they keep changing terms, so we don't catch on to their deeds) is responsible for inflation.
    <b>In short, what is inflation or Quantitative Easing today?</b>
    It's printing more money and dumping it into the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù.
    It starts with governments asking for more units of currency that they need in the circulating supply (so they can keep up with the decrease in the public budget that is anyway mismanaged or mostly secretly divided between politicians and mostly not used for the people).
    Why do they need more units of currency in circulation? Well, they need to increase the budget to keep up with their robbery and the infrastructure costs of the country. So, by having more tax income from us, the little ants, the little workers, can keep up their robbery.
    Technically, what first happens is that governments sell specific bonds to banks, and banks are allowed to create money out of nothing, 9 times more than the value of the bonds they purchase by creating numbers in a database, for example when you are approved for a loan.
    Next, having an approved loan, the account that you have with the bank simply magically appears to now have more valueless digital numbers. So, at the stroke of a few keys, they (the bank employees) create ‚Äúlegal‚Äù units of currency that did not exist before that approval.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    It's like magic, Puff! and the total circulating supply is now bigger for no reason other than to keep corrupt people in power, to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.
    This is what it means to print more money into circulation and yes, they are allowed to do this as we explained before, because we allow them to do this, because we participate in their rigged system by using their currency as if there are no alternatives. Ever heard of GRAT?
    So now, the people (collectively, the whole economy) dispose of a bigger circulating supply of currency that has not earned its bread, a currency that does not represent anything real. This is what it means to control the purchasing power of entire nations.
    By having more units of currency available to the local markets, outsiders (people and organizations or governments that are involved commercially with your national currency) must fight less for a good rate of exchange because more people are offering to sell at cheaper and cheaper prices (competition). This means that the national currency devaluates for your country and all other main currencies appreciate against the national currency. This is how they strangulate (not regulate) the world.
    Having to pay more units of the national currency because of a higher external currencies prices for all goods and services provided by both domestic and foreign companies, the average citizen now has less purchasing power for goods and services.
    Since the domestic or local providers of goods and services now get less value from their activity, they increase their prices to keep up with the increased costs of their business. A chain reaction is triggered where everyone increases prices for goods and services.
    <b>This is the end of an inflation cycle</b>, and these cycles are endless in an inflationary system. And at the end of this artificially controlled cycle, they (the system makers) intentionally burst the bubble on big markets to create panic. We panic, recessions happen and they keep buying up the entire world at super discount prices because they are the ones drawing the charts.

        <page class="page"><img class="fullWidth stickTop" src="/white-paper/img/first-bank-issued-card.jpg" alt="first bank issued card" loading="lazy"/>













            
<strong class="centered">1946</strong>    John Biggins of the Flatbush National Bank of Brooklin in New York created the first bank-issued card with the "Charge-it" system.
    This was the beginning of the idea of a credit card. A credit card to this day is nothing but a key to access money deposited in a bank through the internet. In 1950 Frank Macnamara created the Diners Club card which allowed cardholders to pay at restaurants and get billed after.
    In the following years, the concept of electronic debit and credit cards took off, and soon, all banks were using them.
    Initially, the banks used electronic cards in combination with ATMs to give their clients the ability to withdraw paper money without having to interact with a human, the ATM reduced human resources costs.
    After this, banks implemented payment systems both at physical locations for companies and soon you could use your credit card to pay for internet orders from home using their systems which were full of security flaws as they always used old/deprecated software.

    <b>confinity.com</b> and <b>x.com</b> merged and created <b>paypal.com</b>
    They enabled their users to send money peer to peer (PC to PC) directly using the internet.
	An electronic wallet revolution took off (software wallets) and people could access online services which made it so much easier and cheaper to send money across big distances, around the world, instantly, without ever leaving the house.
	Services like Western Union which cost a fortune and for which you had to travel to a physical location soon had fewer and fewer users. More and more people switched from services like postal money transfer, Western Union, and others as they bought computers and connected them to the internet.
	The new generation of internet users would never even know what Western Union was all about. Sending money through the internet instantly was the new way of storing and transacting currency for both private individuals and commercial companies.
    PayPal would become the world's biggest P2P (Peer to Peer) money transfer service which also offered a bridge for banks. Because of this bridge, PayPal was ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to grow.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    In essence, technology had evolved to the point where transacting globally would become much more efficient due to the adoption of the IP (the Internet Protocol) by more and more people.
    Still, PayPal had many issues to solve in order to convert most of the world's people to users of PayPal. Because they failed to keep innovating, currently they are in a decline.
    To this day, banks and services like PayPal can't solve many critical issues with banking because they require too much personal information from people, their fees are high for what they offer today and their system is centralized and vulnerable to hacking.
    <img src="/white-paper/img/bitcoin.jpg" alt="bitcoin" loading="lazy"/><strong class="centered">2009</strong>  A mysterious developer known by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, a decentralized and anonymous virtual currency.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">The future of storing value</h2>
    Bitcoin introduced the idea that Second Layer internet technology (blockchain) could be applied as a Monetary System.
    It demonstrated a <b>trustless decentralized consensus mechanism</b> which could not be hacked or turned off and which eliminated the need for an intermediary (like a bank) to be able to almost instantly store and transfer digital currency, with incredibly low fees, anywhere in the world, through the internet.
    Bitcoin was just the first of many. People could soon use a very simple crypto wallet app to store or transfer their cryptocurrency or tokens instead of using banks for storing and transferring fiat currencies like Yens, Euros, Dollars, Pounds, etc.
    By using this new technology you become your own bank through a simple secure app. The system is in essence a network of copies of an ingenious open-sourced software hosted on computers and servers across the world which are maintained by people that don't know each other.
    This is where the trustless quality comes from. Nobody owns the system. The power of decentralized open-source software is disruptive but revolutionary if used correctly.
    This new blockchain system is able to store all the copies of an ever-expanding ledger (an extremely encrypted database of all the accounts and transactions in the system that ever happened and that ever will happen).
    This ledger basically manages itself without having any points of access to its accounts for anyone inside or outside of it. In other words, the people hosting all the open-source software of Bitcoin don't have access to any other account except their own accounts, and nobody can spend more than they have or create more units of Bitcoin.
    In essence, Bitcoin solved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending" target="_blank">the double-spending problem</a> and added peer-to-peer (global decentralization) to the system. It was the perfect example of a digital currency system worthy of the start of the age of interstellar travel.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    In such a system, the code is publicly maintained and developed by volunteering developers.
    We are talking about a totally different type of database, a way of storing information in a network that cannot be turned off due to its decentralized nature (like torrents) and in a way such that the records or information of any account can never be manipulated by anyone, ever.
    In this system, you are the only one with the keys to your account and if you lose those keys, nobody will ever be able to access your account and do transactions with it, period.
    The system emits units of currency by rewarding all the people supporting the hardware infrastructure which validates all the transactions between the accounts.
    These people are called ‚Äúminers‚Äù and the activity of miners is called mining. The process of mining is defined by a PoW (Proof of Work) protocol, basically an Adaptive Method of Stable Currency Emission.
    In other words, instead of giving power to bankers to unfairly distribute money into circulation by creating infinite amounts of money out of nothing and forcing us to work years of our lives to pay back the debt, we can see an alternative was demonstrated through this PoW system where the money is distributed directly to those who participate in the support of its infrastructure (hardware and software).
    Companies, Countries, and all of us together should really be more grateful and rewarding to the people building and maintaining the infrastructure.
    There is one big environmental problem with PoW though, the network of computers supporting the Bitcoin software consumes as much electricity as a few developed countries combined. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change soon, as whales now have a big influence on the Bitcoin mining activity.
    Only 21 million units of Bitcoin will ever be emitted in circulation. Having a fixed monetary supply means that the price of Bitcoin will always appreciate over the years since more and more users agree that it's a better system and exchange their fiat money for Bitcoin.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <b>Finally!</b> A better, future-proof alternative to the corrupt fiat money system was demonstrated and anyone could exchange some of their fiat money into Bitcoin which would always appreciate over time as it is a deflationary monetary system, just like the dollar was when it was on the Gold Standard.
    Many early Bitcoin adopters that mined or purchased Bitcoin became multi-millionaires. Software developers and tech gurus started paying attention. Tech people will be the majority of billionaires in the near future.
    It's sad that the banking elite intervened here as well. They are behind most brokers and exchanges and they are always accumulating most of the supply, creating extreme volatility and creating artificial economic bubbles that have a negative impact on the price.
    Their manipulation is making it impossible for people to use Bitcoin as short-term value storage as their money can sometimes (in some years) depreciate up to 50% over a few days, making them panic sell, and lose <b>hard earned value</b>.
    From pebbles to Bitcoin, it doesn't really matter when was the first time the idea of money appeared in our collective unconscious or in our species' consciousness, what is important is why?
    Not why it appeared, but why did it persist?
    I suppose to make life easier people have always looked for ways to store the results of their efforts into smaller objects that they could carry around more easily. This is why currencies appeared, and with the passing of time they became so small that they vanished completely, virtual symbols took their place.
    Early humans, or any advanced civilization that evolved enough to be able to create value through making things and trading them or discovering information and trading information (like maps or other types of knowledge about the world and how it works) at some point collectively decided it was a good idea to have a symbolic representation (money) that could be divided into lots of smaller units to make trade more efficient and to safely store the value they created over time.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Ideally, we would want to live in a world without money, where a borderless biosphere resource-based economy would take the place of this corruptible money world, where greed was completely replaced with gratitude.
    But transitioning to that world is done with baby steps, we need a better monetary system first.
    Money should not be the main life goal of any individual, rather it should be a powerful tool to invest in ourselves and in others, a tool to support and empower what we love, for the benefit of all participants in that system, not at the expense of them.
    All children and all adults should know that money is simply a representation of the <b>Energy</b> you spend over <b>Time</b>. E/T=M.
    The symbol we call money, once gifted, must be protected and it must be spent wisely, it should not be hoarded or blocked, stolen, or spent selfishly.
    Sadly, today money is useful only to those who control and regulate it. If you and I were the only people alive, nobody would need it. Decentralization is about value/wealth redistribution.
    All that money ever was and that ever will be is just a consensual symbolic representation of how much energy was spent to create or offer something to another human being. Money persisted as the idea to store this energy spent by another in a more efficient way.

    <b>Energy is supposed to flow freely, without too many stops or intermediaries.</b>

    As an analogy, if blockages would happen in an organic system like your sanguine system, you would have a heart attack or stroke and die. Every time we stop energy or movement, trouble comes, economic bubbles explode, people suffer or even die directly because of this.
    When we have an intermediary for energy transfer, the nature of the intermediary determines the biospheric sustainability of the system and the longevity of the species using it.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    The development of new internet technology finally allows us to eliminate any intermediaries between individuals and companies.
    We can finally store our efforts into decentralized systems that are reliable, trustless and require no <b>Straw Man identity</b> verification (meaning the transactions we make with these systems are anonymous and for some cryptocurrencies completely untraceable).
    <b>Enough with the Orwellian Surveillance Capitalism.</b>
    In a free world and free market, value is something that we all seek long term. It comes in many forms or symbols. Price is just the indicator of how many seek at the moment to invest in a certain symbol and by doing so support the system that manages everyone's share of that symbol/system.
    Most cryptocurrencies or tokens are decentralized and deflationary monetary systems.
    In this type of system, those who exchange their fiat money or other cryptocurrencies into the new Token or Coin early on are called ‚Äúearly adopters‚Äù - they have patience and are rewarded long-term by the increase in demand for that certain symbol.
    People that invest after the launch must wait at least as much as the early adopters to have benefits, otherwise, they might see the price decrease in some periods and panic-sell their crypto-currency or crypto token. Investors must only invest what they can afford to block long term. 
    These systems are basically digital networks running on the first global layer of the internet, in other words, the Internet Protocol (IP) - which is simply the result of our global consensus on how to exchange or communicate information or content digitally. Upon this First Layer Global Consensus, we can now develop the Second Layer or (Middle Layer) applications using blockchain-type technologies and new protocols.
    In the future, all money will be stored in these new systems using the new protocols, not in banks. Banks, as we know them today, will be a thing of the past.

Just like people collectively make up One Humanity (or should I say one Mind with the big M, or maybe you prefer Collective Mind or Collective Unconscious) - we all make-up a single ever-growing network of life forms that are all the parts of Terra, a living organism, a higher consciousness.
    Similarly, you are a higher consciousness or awareness than the awareness of a single cell in your body.
    We, humans, are a family, a group, a collective, a species, and together we are all ONE.
    Our planet is One organism, One object, One system, One cosmic agent.
    Virtual networks are just symbolic representations of natural networks and they should not be confused for reality or nature.
    Although representations do require real objects or systems to exist, or should I say, for us to be able to perceive them‚Ä¶ in the end any virtual symbol which is a small part of a bigger group of symbols (like currency) is an abstraction of nature, it's not the real physical nature.

    <b>We all know where this comes from right?</b>
    It's on the dollar bills, A.K.A. ‚ÄúThe world reserve currency‚Äù.
    We were born into their pyramid world, into a hierarchy ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù where we are obligated to use one specific symbol to manage our transactions (our physical interaction with reality).
    Nobody asked you if you agree to use Euros or Dollars as the symbol that can represent universal value which allows you to exchange that value for something you desire. You were just born and forced into this rule, a law that was enforced in the past, possibly with good intentions initially. But slavery was legal too and it took so much sacrifice and revolt to overcome this evil human written rule or law. We evolved and now we need to evolve past the usury of bankers and their fiat system, again, but for good this time.
    If we give up the power to create these units of symbols (currency) and to regulate how they are distributed to all people, we should not be surprised about the inequality in our reality.
    This 1% vs 99% global gap situation that we live in currently exists because there is no decentralization, no uniform distribution.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  Every day we agree to the rules of a centralized non-human cabal. We agree to conduct ourselves through their pyramid model (a hierarchical system) that will always eventually destroy its host, for it does not know how to live in symbiosis. It's parasitic in nature and if parasites win by ignorantly killing the host, we all go extinct.
    You see, the ignorance of our connection with nature that is maintained due to subscribing to this type of hierarchical thinking will lead to self-destruction by consumption of natural resources and to the destruction of the environment where these resources grow.
    This is a tragic attack on our mother Terra and its amazing biosphere. An attack enacted over millennia by these seemingly sociopathic individuals.
    These poor emotionless caterpillars should not be called The Elite for they are completely unaware of what they are doing to the Earth, the source of all life. They should be known for what they are, a species of emotionless beings who need to understand that if they don't give up control of the wheel, they turn into moths instead of butterflies and we are all headed for extinction.
    Whistleblower <b>Karen Hudes</b>, an ex-lawyer of the World Bank is one of the humans recently shedding light on this egomaniacal group and their agenda, you can look her up. She revealed this secret cabal that has been running the monetary systems, and the trade policies of the world for thousands of years.
    One of the more interesting aspects of her disclosures of which people around the world are not yet aware enough to grasp is that these individuals at the top of the pyramid are not public personas and they are not of the species Homo Sapiens, rather they are descendants of the Pharaohs of Egypt which are in turn descendants of the survivors of the city of Atlantis and although not many know this, their species is called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=homo+capensis&t=h_&iar=images" target="_blank">„Éõ„É¢„Ç´„Éö„É≥„Ç∑„Çπ</a>.
    The arrow or pyramid symbol is a negatively polarized model of mind, it represents intellect and intellect can only understand reality by destroying it, by cutting it and slicing it into smaller parts to see how it all works together and then consuming all the parts for assimilation (different than integration).
        </page>
        <page class="page">  Our collective consciousness is in a total sum of vibrations that unfortunately includes greed. Greedy beings are negatively engaged with nature, and they are destroying nature. Greed is a symptom of disconnection from nature, from feelings, from the Source of Consciousness (A.K.A. God).
    Human beings are not born with this feeling, we learn it by misunderstanding life & death. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=homo+capensis&t=h_&iar=images" target="_blank">„Éõ„É¢„Ç´„Éö„É≥„Ç∑„Çπ</a> made sure to scare us into believing false constructs, they worked hard for the last few centuries to transform the educational system into a tool that makes us more like them, to work only with our intellect and never with our emotions. They want indoctrinated factory workers that use herd logic and trust the Status Quo.
    Greed, the natural state of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=homo+capensis&t=h_&iar=images" target="_blank">„Éõ„É¢„Ç´„Éö„É≥„Ç∑„Çπ</a>, is a suppressor of higher vibrations, of higher emotions and by its very nature, it can only create more disconnection and division. Greed is a characteristic of beings that have low empathy or no feelings, they are driven purely by intellect and an unquenchable thirst for power over nature, even their own nature.
    Humans are on the path to maturing enough to overcome this programmed <b>Greed Based Model of Thinking</b> and we are close to curing our collective unconscious of parasitic models of thought. But for that, we need to be open to the possibility that we were ignorant, we didn't know that the world is not really run by Homo Sapiens. We need to grow our awareness and understand that some of us are, unfortunately, due to our imbalanced education, strongly controlled by greed and ignorance. I was in that place too. This happened without our choice in the matter, it's the result of our unfortunate indoctrination as kids. Most of us can be often selfish people or even sociopathic in behavior, but in the end, we are human beings, and we will be healed from greed when we won't have any better choice than to follow our hearts, our emotions when greed will no longer serve us in a heartful world of curiosity, love and joy.
    The only way to uniformly share our collective value and creativity in a way that empowers everyone equally is to distribute an open-source, trustless, deflationary, and decentralized token and nurture its mass adoption.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><b>When we really understand the problem, we already have the answer.</b>
    If the digital symbols or virtual representations of all free human enterprise are distributed fairly and uniformly among all humans, a Biospheric Internet will replace the Pyramid Internet.
    This type of collective consciousness is a system that can sustain itself without consuming its environment. More on this later.
    The relationship between an object and an abstraction or representation, no matter how complex, can be described by quoting the legendary Alan Watts: ‚Äú<b>The menu is not the meal</b>‚Äù. We should really understand this relationship because it implies the question: <b>What is real?</b>
    To give one answer to this question, I will quote from Mr. Robot Netflix series (Season 1, Episode 10):
    <i>‚ÄúWe live in a world built on fantasy.
    Synthetic emotions in the form of pills.
    Psychological warfare in the form of advertising.
    Mind-altering chemicals in the form of food.
    Brainwashing seminars in the form of media.
    Controlled isolated bubbles in the form of social networks.
    Real?
    You want to talk about reality?
    We have not lived in anything remotely close to it since the turn of the century.
    We turned it off, took out the batteries, snacked on a bag of GMOs while we tossed the remnants in the ever-expanding dumpster of the human condition.
    We live in branded houses, trademarked by corporations, built on bipolar numbers, jumping up and down on digital displays, hypnotizing us into the biggest slumber mankind has ever seen.
    You have to dig pretty deep kiddo before you can find anything real.
    We live in a kingdom of bullshit. A kingdom you lived in for far too long.‚Äù</i>
        </page>
        <page class="page">    When we think of networks today, our first thought is of a digital or virtual network, but networks are not just digital, they are also real, physical, just like neurons and synapses and all biological networks.

<h2 class="heading">Consensus</h2>
    To further understand <b>value</b>, we must understand <b>consensus</b>.
    Consensus is basically the degree to which people agree on something, the ultimate reality of this agreement is both physical in nature and virtual for our Digital Selves. There are 2 sides, 1 coin.
    Higher consensus creates a more stable and lasting value or reveals a better evidence-based truth or information, it offers stability.
    To know we possess something of value to others gives us security.
    Ideally, when our basic physical needs are met, we constantly seek valuable things or valuable skills, veritable interests, and hobbies. When they aren't met, we seek comfort or we are in survival mode.
    In our ‚Äúmodern‚Äù societies, we currently regard virtual services as the dominant value store in our life, we rely on our digital networks.
    We cannot eat symbols, yet by constantly trading symbols for things, services, experiences we support and maintain their existence, their network.
    High collective consensus about symbols motivates us to invest in them and in return, the financial efforts of investors get multiplied and the rewards can be amazing, but only if the symbols represent benevolent initiatives.
    So, we pay it forward, we pass it on, this is the nature of currency or symbols. But we must always remember: <b>if most of the currency supply does not circulate from person to person, many people suffer and the whole system can even collapse.</b>
    If people like something, they usually want to sustain its development. The more people like it, the higher the consensus about its value or utility. This is how crowd-funded ideas become real, how modern artists make a living, how emergency situations are resolved and how lives are saved. GRAT is also represented by a fast-growing consensus.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    In the same way, currencies, most assets, contracts, and almost every exchange with another individual are all possible because of this, because we measure our reality constantly and decide whether to accept the value that others created before us.
    Today the value of fiat currency (Yens, Euros, Pounds, Dollars, etc.) is insured by nothing but a false promise from greedy <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=homo+capensis&t=h_&iar=images" target="_blank">„Éõ„É¢„Ç´„Éö„É≥„Ç∑„Çπ</a>. Have you measured the consensus about that lately?
    You see, as humans, our hyperactive mind keeps on desiring things or skills valued by others, but deep inside, we seek appreciation from others, we would rather seek love, wonder, and joy instead of greed, vanity, or money.
    <b>Would you agree with the following?:</b>
    <i>A house is more valuable than a car, a car is more valuable than a stove, a stove is more valuable than a knife.
    A haircut is less valuable than car insurance, car insurance is less valuable than renting an apartment, renting an apartment is less valuable than a job, a job is less valuable than a successful business.</i>
    Did you see how your mind started evaluating value, swinging from objectivity to subjectivity? We usually regard something physical as having objective value, but services or information are also valuable and they're not immediately or directly physical, we don't own them because they are processes happening naturally in our reality.
    Still, information must be stored on something ultimately physical (be it an organic brain or a USB stick), services require physical objects/tools.
    No matter what we DO when we are evaluating or deciding how to save and multiply our efforts, we cannot get rid of the physical reality of storing value. Furthermore, information is only useful to us to the degree it can give us access to things, services, experiences, and ultimately the life we desire.
    The ultimate outcome of learning new information is simply to create a richer physical reality for ourselves to enjoy or to play with, in creative ways.
    <b>Dance while the music is playing!</b>
    Another time might be too late.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Goods, products, are things that we can measure, we can evaluate them using our own criteria or knowledge which comes essentially from our information about those physical objects and all their parts, but also from a rough idea of how many other people regard those objects as valuable to any degree.
    We measure the value of any object regardless of the set price. Anyone can set a price, but in the end, our own evaluation is the most important for us as individuals. If we don't agree with the price, no matter the high consensus, we won't buy. If the value we get from things or services has an unfair price, the consensus doesn't make sense.
    This is what greed does, it destroys consensus. If there is no consensus, the value becomes Subjective Value.

    The culture most of us grew up in has not prepared us at all for what we need to DO, to create our dream life.
    Rather it educated us on how to become a cog in a system of endless survival, work, misery, boredom, and suffering. It tricked us into believing we are so small, just an employee.
    It never taught us how to use our mind and energy more and more efficiently.
    But we can DO this simply by getting good at something we love.
    The things we love bring us joy and joy is the ultimate reservoir of endless energy for human beings.
    We should NOT be thinking about how to get more money, how to hoard more units of currency or other symbols, and fall into the trap of thinking that if we had more money, we could have everything we ever wanted.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    That way of thinking will only bring us extreme vanity and selfishness while we fall into the dark side of humanity, consuming everything ignorantly.
    Studies show that over 90% of all the people who won the lottery, in a few years ended up worse than they were before they won.
    <b>Do you understand what this means?</b>
    Having money is not the correct answer to our dream life. Doing what we love for daily joy, being grateful for that opportunity, and for what life has to offer is the only sustainable way to live our desired life.
    We need to stop thinking about what type of job is highly paid, let's think instead about what is valuable to us in our dream life. What did you enjoy doing as a child? What brings you joy? DO that, get good at it without thinking of a retirement plan. Serve yourself first, then others.
    When our energy is spent efficiently by living, by taking the risk of doing what we love every day, the act of creation is perfected and others will appreciate and value the quality of our actions, they will feel gratitude. If we unite through the vibration of gratitude, miracles really can happen.
    You see, by natural desire, interest, or curiosity, when people come together and join forces to support the development of an idea, great things appear in our reality, the impossible becomes possible. And we don't all have to be developers, engineers, or scientists, but we all must have a better relationship with value and the representation of it, we must all have a better way of expressing our gratitude for the things or people we love in this world, otherwise, it's very difficult for crowds of people to take the right action.
    We need an open-source decentralized tool to share some of our accumulated value. Let's create things we desire so we can enjoy them in our own life. For one, the idea of crowdfunding and donations should not be mostly represented only in one of a few places like Kickstarter where people go to invest money to support the production of a certain product filtered through a process regulated by a centralized private company that provides the service and which is accepting only methods of payments controlled by the banks.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Instead, it should be an open-source universal quality built in everywhere, in all apps, websites, and even physical places.
    It should be a service that is defined by a highly benevolent consensus, with the ability to transfer value at the click/touch of a button, a form of value flow without intermediaries.
    In this new open-source paradigm, solutions will be demonstrated which will allow us to offer any type of digital service that will not be financed by advertising or banks.
    Ads will no longer be needed to reach potential clients.
    The end of the psychological warfare era called "advertising" will set us free and empower us in ways we cannot even imagine yet.
    Companies will no longer demand for us to give away our data and our privacy so they can farm profits from it.
    This is possible now using blockchain technology and we will demonstrate this, keep reading to find out how.
    What crypto is doing for decentralizing currencies through blockchain technology, the right solution could also DO for universal crowdfunding and donations.
    People need a little help to overcome the world built on greed and the only way to DO that is to be in a daily state of gratitude and participation.
    We all need tools to be able to offer our gratitude any time we want and we need them now.
    We have the technology to build tools to support the work on the materialization of an idea or to support researchers, artists, writers, journalists, and really anyone.
    This should be accessible to everyone, everywhere, at any time and we should all be part of this revolution.

<h2 class="heading">Giving away personal information</h2>
    Having access to online websites, apps, services should not obligate us to give away so much of our personal information.
    Users should be able to choose how much personal information they want to give away and the services must accommodate the different levels of information they receive, nobody should exclude someone just because they don't have a corporate identity, an ID card for example, or if they don't have an email, a home address, or if they don't have a utility bill or bank statement.
    People are not products. Our "national security" number which is nothing but a bar code for "human assets" should be abolished and all humans should have access to the digital side of humanity.
    Some might argue that without giving away this information we cannot protect the users of a digital service, especially a financial service offered by a financial company. This is completely false, having so much personal information about the users does not serve to protect the users, it serves only the corporations that covet this big data. Through our agreement or consent, they can then find new ways to harness value out of our data, and of course, they can even sell it to other parties as they please.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica" target="_blank">Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>?
    Most companies can sell your information because you agree to their terms & conditions which you never read. So legally, they are allowed to do it.
    The terms & conditions of big corporations are the only thing you need to prove they are not concerned for the wellbeing of the users. The internet made it very easy for sociopaths to manipulate us to sign contracts that make us their assets.
    The internet was meant to be a free space where anyone can join and explore, just like in the real world, but in reality, things are very different, maybe even opposite. Companies that demand all your personal information to offer you a malevolent service disguised as a benevolent service do not offer any protection at all, just like in the real world nobody can guarantee that you will eat a meal, have no accidents, or even survive every day.
    These companies are concerned only about profits extracted from information/content we the people possess or create and they obligate us to share our information, our life ... every second of it, in greater and greater detail, so they can better target their advertisement system.
    <b>The madness called advertising must end if we are to evolve as a species.</b>
<h2 class="heading">Don't work for money, work for each other</h2>
    In an ideal society, we don't need a job to survive, instead, we have a right to choose either to simply live, enjoy being alive, or we can DO more than that.
    We can all try to serve humanity without contracts, without placing money first and people second.
    Everyone offers their services, favors, or work and some of us just don't think about money when we do it because we don't do it for money.
    We all want to DO favors for friends and people we love and it's ok to expect something in return when your objective is altruistic. But what we expect in return doesn't have to be money. Services are about doing things for ourselves and others.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <b>Consider these perspectives:</b>
            
    <i>1. Working for money instead of ourselves is just like slavery, but with extra steps.

    2. Fuck taxes, they're only feeding corrupt politicians, let's crowd-fund everything!

    3. Instead of seeking the slave money in everything, let's seek the value of Gratitude.</i>
            
<h2 class="heading">Services</h2>
    The fact that humans offer services or favors is an indication of our natural inclination towards collaboration and sharing.
    It doesn't matter if we do them from self-interest or altruism, the tendency or quality remains. We DO for others. We serve not only ourselves, but others as well. Doing and acting for others seems to be part of our natural attraction to others.
    We, the new generation of the 21'st century prefer to lean toward coming together, sharing, and forming networks instead of isolating ourselves from others to hoard everything, no matter if it's virtual or physical.
    This is an indication that our species is ready to transition from flat or 2D hierarchical networks to 3D biospheric networks.
    Ready or not, we need to make the shift to a Biosphere Consciousness, our continuity as a species depends on it, all life in the biosphere depends on it.
    If it's sleeping in a hotel, getting a haircut, eating food that others made, an internet subscription, access to information/content, online shopping and delivery, insurance, all these services involve you interacting with real physical things and real physical people. At least, that has been the story so far. Things are changing, fast.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    The long-term value we see in things or services comes from their utility. The demand for any service or product disappears when a much better service or product with the same utility but better performance and/or better price is available.
    In general, services imply an exchange with some form of fungible value in order to access them.
    All the above come from human interactions with the ‚Äúphysical reality‚Äù (digital or analog) which sometimes includes other humans. Going forward with this fact, nothing we create has any value if there is no human interaction.

<h2 class="heading">Creativity</h2>  
    Everything we value is an act of creation.
    Nothing can exist without this act.
    The act of creation is always evaluated or measured by others. If you think about it in terms of universal laws and principles, the value of creativity is directly proportional to movement and choices. There are forces at play to create value. A creator uses forces already existing and knowledge (the experience with those forces) to reconfigure his reality.
    From creating a clay pot to creating an entire universe, a creator merely uses what is already here and configures or combines it into something different.
    A creator is a transformer of reality, an alchemist, a shaper of reality. It doesn't mean he/she makes something of nothing. Not literally.
    We need something to create something else, if there is nothing, we cannot experience it.
    Consciousness cannot experience anything outside of itself. In other words, we can't experience something from nothing, these opposites don't work together.
    What we create is but a transformation of what is already there, we can't experience it otherwise.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Consciousness is not its own observer, if there is no consciousness, there is simply nothing so we have no existence.
    An infinite number of possibilities is nothing until we make a choice.
    That's exactly where creation begins. That's the bridge, the door and the key. Creation is a quality of consciousness, the more consciousness, the more complex the creation.

<h2 class="heading">Consumption</h2>
    Since the act of creation is based on physical reality, we must realize that there is no creation without consumption or assimilation.
    Once we create something we must allow ourselves and others to engage with it or assimilate it, either as physical experience/interaction or as information/knowledge.
    An act of creation requires ingredients, parts. It's not enough to know how to create something. Physical materials, tools, and processes (technology) are required to manifest something into the physical realm. Without consuming parts of what is already created, nothing new can come into existence.
    In the past, writers needed paper and pen, today they need a computer‚Ä¶ different tools of different complexity, but the same result or same act. To make a clay pot requires pre-made clay that was created from natural elements and a pre-constructed spinning wheel mechanism made from different materials. From that to making a car or a smartphone requires many more parts and processes discovered by many people, all of which developed over time, not all at once.
    The creation of all those parts is the result of concentrated human creativity over generations. In other words, the work of many combined to create one complex product or service.
    Creation does not destroy, it only transforms. As we know from physics, nothing can be destroyed, it can only be transformed.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    <b>The problem with our species was never consumption, it was always the fact that we keep throwing away what we transform</b> as if there is such a thing as ‚Äúaway‚Äù on a finite planet. We were never taught to ask ourselves: <b>Where do we put the things we no longer want or need?</b>
    Can't we take care of things and ourselves in a better way? Of course, we can! We were just never taught to think like this, to ask these questions from a young age. <b>Let's DO it now!</b>
    <b>Remember that sharing is caring</b> and that the things that no longer serve you, that no longer attract you, should be given away to others, not hoarded.
    <b>Remember what happens when we block energy?</b>
    Things and objects are not just things, they are the main ingredient of somebody's joy! If they are serving properly, they are energy generators, if they are hoarded in a place somewhere, they become energy blockers.
    And remember to fix the broken things, don't throw them away, and what is even greater, this also applies to broken people.
    We can mend their spirit, we can infuse the loving human spirit in their bodies once again.

    <b>Greed</b> is never stopping to enjoy what you've got for a while, daily.
    <b>Gratitude</b> is never stopping from enjoying what you've got for a while, daily.
    Do you see the difference?
    Gratitude allows us to be in perfect clarity and control over every moment of our lives. Birth and death don't happen just once. Every day you are reborn or remain who you were yesterday. It all depends on how much gratitude you have for your life. Practice it, witness miracles in your life.
    <i>To the grateful eyes, life is wonderful. To the ungrateful eyes, life is misery.</i>

        <page class="page">    Gratitude represents the effortless daily ritualized surrender, which is like a gentle ego death, with the extra benefit that, compared to a total Ego Death where you actually ‚Äúlose consciousness‚Äù (or should I say: return to the source and then come back), gratitude is painless, it's free and the results over time are way better and more persistent.

    Let's talk a bit about desires or dreams and about discipline.
    As humans we all have desires, but they don't mean anything and they cannot all be satisfied just because we have them. Our desires come from our hyperactive expanding ego in an age with overwhelming amounts of information and possibilities.
    To desire strongly is not the answer we are looking for, desires are raw thought impulses. The answer to our dreams will come from a profound introspective that results in our understanding that we are dealing with an impossible problem since we were very young.
    That problem is a defective or false sense of identity.
    But not all kids have this problem, for example, Asian or Indian kids have a better culture in this sense, they are taught since they are young that they are the earth, the water, the stones, and all the elements that make up the universe.
    So now, young or old, we must all really understand <b>who we are</b>. Just as any truly spiritual person knows, we are not just the name we are given, we are not just our occupation, we are not our sex or our species, we are the entire universe or creation. We are not outside or inside, we are both.
    Then, we must understand truly that life is about joy and gratitude, about what brings us these states.
    We can choose to seek gratitude, joy, and discipline daily, or we can engage in lower vibrational states that come from ego desires, but no matter what we seek, it all requires a lot of discipline and cyclical/repetitive work of
        </page>
        <page class="page">accumulating knowledge on one side and testing that knowledge/idea or practicing it on the other side. This is the yin and yang of the Taoists, this is Principle and Process as one single object. If we apply this, our dreams are possible, and fulfilling them doesn't require much time, because time is an illusion.
    If we feel the life that we already have is not enough, that we are meant for more, the best we can do is dedicate our lives to a discipline, to explore and conquer at least one science or art that we can practice throughout our life.
    This will bring us experience and satisfaction.
    Without experience in a science or art, we are lost to our emotions (driven by ego desires or fears, by lesser thoughts), we become a victim of life instead of a creator of it.
    In other words, we let the servant be the master, we let our mind (a limited tool) define something infinite and immortal: our spirit, our very soul, or consciousness if you will.
    <i><b>‚ÄúThe mind is a good servant, but a bad master.‚Äù</b></i> ‚Äì Alan Watts

    Looking up studies on <b>Google Scholar</b> related to gratitude:
    1,840,000 results for ‚Äúgratitude study‚Äù
    973,000 results related to ‚Äúgratitude test‚Äù
    673,000 results related to ‚Äúgratitude experiment‚Äù
    I have totally not read them all, but I experienced the effects of daily gratitude firsthand, and I did read enough of them. The benefits I experienced and read about are described a little in this below article I like from today.com:
    <i>If you need one more reason to be thankful, here it is. More and more researchers are finding that gratitude doesn't just make you feel like a better person, it's actually good for your health.
    ‚ÄúClinical trials indicate that the practice of gratitude can have dramatic and lasting effects in a person's life,‚Äù said Robert A. Emmons, professor of</i>
        </page>
        <page class="page"><i>psychology at UC Davis. ‚ÄúIt can lower blood pressure, improve immune function and facilitate more efficient sleep.‚Äù
    One recent study from the University of California San Diego's School of Medicine found that people who were more grateful actually had better heart health, specifically less inflammation and healthier heart rhythms.
    ‚ÄúThey showed a better well-being, a less depressed mood, less fatigue and they slept better,‚Äù said the study's author, Paul J. Mills. ‚ÄúWhen I am more grateful, I feel more connected with myself and with my environment. That's the opposite of what stress does.‚Äù
    Another study found that gratitude can boost your immune system. Researchers at the universities of Utah and Kentucky observed that stressed-out law students who characterized themselves as optimistic actually had more disease-fighting cells in their bodies.
    But Emmons said there's even more evidence.
    People who keep a gratitude journal have a reduced dietary fat intake ‚Äî as much as 25 percent lower. Stress hormones like cortisol are 23 percent lower in grateful people. And having a daily gratitude practice could actually reduce the effects of aging to the brain.
    Being thankful has such a profound effect because of the feelings that go along with it, Emmons said.
    ‚ÄúGratitude works because, as a way of perceiving and interpreting life, it recruits other positive emotions that have direct physical benefits, most likely through the immune system or endocrine system.‚Äù
    Research shows that when we think about what we appreciate, the parasympathetic or calming part of the nervous system is triggered and that can have protective benefits on the body, including decreasing cortisol levels and perhaps increasing oxytocin, the bonding hormone involved in relationships that make us feel so good.
    But if you're still not feeling the love, experts say gratitude is something you can learn.
    ‚ÄúSome people may not be grateful by nature, but it is a habit you can get</i>

        <page class="page"><i>accustomed to,‚Äù said Dr. Norman Rosenthal, a psychiatrist and author of ‚ÄúWinter Blues.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúOne very good way is being aware of comparing up. It's a formula for unhappiness because you can always find a person who is more advantaged than you are.‚Äù
    Mills says all you have to do is think about being grateful and you'll become more grateful.
    A good way to do that is by journaling.
    ‚ÄúSome people say they don't have anything to be grateful for,‚Äù Mills said. ‚ÄúIf you take such a person to find one little thing to be grateful for and focus on that, you find over time that the feeling of gratitude can transform the way they see their lives.‚Äù</i><div style="text-align: right;">Source: <a href="https://www.today.com/health/be-thankful-science-says-gratitude-good-your-health-t58256" target="_blank">Today.com</a></div>

<h3 class="heading">The positive side of humanity</h3>
    <i>From all human emotions, Gratitude is the one that can give us the world.</i>
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Our website is called <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> for this very reason.
    I couldn't think of a better name to give to our token that will give people the ability to show their gratitude to anyone, anywhere, anytime ‚Äì by gifting or investing Tokens of Gratitude (GRAT).
    This is our fundamental mission, to demonstrate that gratitude can really change the world for the better. We want you the reader to discover that: <i><b>Gratitude is the new attitude.</b></i>

<h3 class="heading">An example from my personal life</h3>
	For years I've been criticizing my parents and questioning them as to why they are incapable of fixing or getting an electrician to fix their power outlets and lighting. They have one light bulb that they carry from room to room and extension cords they move from room to room, hanging them in the most inconvenient ways around the house. I was unable to understand, year after year when I visited them, why they cannot fix this one simple but very important thing in the environment in which they dwell, in their home.
    I was ungrateful for their behavior and frankly, even though I love my parents, I didn't think spending a few hours to fix this problem was worth my time; I was unwilling to accept that they are so caught up with life and work and the constant conflicts and traumas that they have in their relationship, that they didn't see the benefits of doing these simple fixes or were not in the right emotional state to be able to take care of themselves.
    I realized after becoming more grateful for my life, for my parents giving me life and raising me as best they could, that if they were capable of doing it, they would have done it. But they were not, so I had to at least do this thing for them.
    So that's what I did, I just looked at the problem through the lens of Gratitude (Thank you Mother and Father for doing your best with me, let me show you how much it means to me), instead of looking at the problem through the lens of Greed (I don't have time for this, my time is mine alone).
        </page>
        <page class="page">    And so, I showed them my appreciation by fixing the power outlets and lights in their house.
    This simple act of caring had an amazing impact on them. It made them feel a little better about their life and motivated them to fix other things and clean the house by themselves.
    Now they are taking care of the house, and their spirit is so much better, they enjoy life more and I enjoy talking to them more and the old conversations about these types of problems are gone. And all I had to do, is switch from Greed to Gratitude and invest a few hours of my time and a few units of local currency.
    
    <b>The <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> project represents the vision that humanity is ready to transition from a linear / bidimensional Privately-Owned-Pyramid Organizational Program (which is basically a hierarchy-based system of thought) - to an Open-Source-Biosphere Organizational Program which is a tridimensional Self-Sustaining Organizational Network, or in other terms, a Self-Emerging, Self-Sustaining and Self-Aware non-linear system of thought. A divine agent.
    The Mission of <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> is to nurture symbiotic instead of parasitic alternatives to global tech services on the Internet Protocol Layer through BiiP, evolving all human organizational programs. Transforming digital processes like authentication, registration, transfer of value, investment, and communications from their core and eliminating the need for advertising and loans/credits in all domains of human activity.</b>

    The founders of <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> aim to transform the way we use the Internet by redefining the way we value / appreciate and interact with everything digital.

        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">Some technical aspects</h2>
    The <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> website is where you can learn about BiiP and the Gratitude Token (GRAT), which are designed as 2 halves of one object. Together they create an innovative solution to decentralize Online Authentication (like the original OAuth idea, but better) and Value Transfer.
    In other words, we are enabling users to quickly register/login on to websites using BiiP (as Google does, without filling out endless forms) while at the same time having a built-in cross-platform token transfer system for investment, payment, and funding, all built into the decentralized protocol. This enables so many possibilities for human digital creativity & interaction.

<h3 class="heading">What are: BiiP and GRAT token?</h3>
    <b>BiiP</b> - Is a unique decentralized user authentication protocol which enables the ability to request access to specific personal data/information and/or to execute blockchain transactions on behalf of the users, both operations being tied to a single unique crypto address.
    BiiP combines Universal Secure Authentication with a Crypto Currency and in the process unifies Money/Currency and Virtual Identity governing in one Decentralized Solution (a full, user controlled process, different from KYC).
    <b>Gratitude (GRAT) Token</b> - Is a deflationary and feeless token with a total supply of 12 billion tokens and it's the native fuel for all of our open-source projects. GRAT token will demonstrate and sustain revolutionary real use cases for the BiiP and beyond it.
    Along with the protocol and token we are constantly growing the <b>GRATITUDE SHIELD</b> and <b>GRATITUDE GENESIS</b> projects which are key to protecting and nurturing the main mission.

    <b>We envision a Biospheric Internet that includes both everyone connected to the surface internet as well as the orbital internet.</b>
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Our solutions will also be accessible to all users of Starlink Internet Service Provider (Elon Musk's network of 5G satellites).
    
    <i><b>As humans, when we appreciate what we are offered, it's wonderful to show how we feel about it. Sharing and collaboration is the basic human behavior.</b></i>
    For example, in social media apps/platforms - we all want to be liked for who we are, maybe even appreciated. We would also like to know if the appreciation is real, therefore, we give up privacy ‚Ä¶ we pay the price of public exposure to be able to be part of it all.
    
    <b>But do we need to give up so much privacy?
    And how do we really want to be appreciated?</b>
    
    <b>Should we buy into:</b>
    Greed, Autonomy, Exclusivity, Vanity, Opulence, Individualism and Jobs?
    <i>Or maybe, just maybe, all these could be upgraded to:</i>
    Gratitude, Interconnectivity, Inclusivity, Modesty, Simplicity, Unity, and Joy.
    
    Imagine seeing someone popular in a video, then consider this:
    People like to shine, to feel special, to get likes, views. Some people even make a living out of this. We call these people Content Creators, Influencers, Actors, Stars, Celebrities, etc (No, not you politicians!).
    Most get paid by the platforms where they post content and the platforms in return for hosting their content get exposure (from all the people viewing their ads). The platforms then sell this exposure to their clients and then finally, they give some crumbs or leftovers to the content authors as well.
    <b>This is modern slavery!</b> and it's stifling human progress.
    The authors should get most of the value from their content.
    We aim to change this greedy model of business based on echo chambers and spying on people.

        <page class="page">    From Creation to Distribution, to Consumption, to Evaluation, to Recognition, and Exposure ‚Äì this unconscious, manipulative operational model can be redefined by GRAT at the Human Digital Core using BiiP which employs revolutionary technology like Universal Crypto Crowdfunding and Decentralized Online Authentication, which will be implemented throughout any/all digital services that join this revolution.

<img class="fullWidth" src="/white-paper/img/technology-girl.jpg" alt="technology virtual interface girl blue" loading="lazy"/>













    <b>TECHNOLOGY ÊäÄË°ì</b> - Is nothing but an extension of our own thoughts or thinking processes.
    From a knife to Artificial Intelligence - technology is not good or bad, it's the makers and users of it that determine that distinction.
    A knife can be used to make food or to kill someone. The knife itself has no qualities like good or bad and just because some people use it as a weapon instead of a tool it does not mean we should forbid the production and use of knives.

        <page class="page">    The technology we call Blockchain is still in its infancy and so far, it mostly benefited the 1%.
    Yes, many other regular people became millionaires, but most people either didn't understand the fundamentals of investing in new technologies or were outright scammed.
    New technology is always exploited first by greedy people, it's unfortunate and it's what we are trying to change.
    Most cryptocurrency or tokens so far have mostly been just symbols for speculation on exchanges, with no real value to life anywhere and no chance to reach mass adoption.
    Crypto tokens are just new, better tools for creating symbols that can represent something of real value, but most have yet to demonstrate a simple and universal way to appreciate or extend that value.
    We must understand that value only comes from people, from all our actions and interactions, nothing else has any real value without people at the core of it.
    Everyone talks about <b>mass adoption</b> but that requires real use cases that create demand, thus increasing the network's growth speed and self-worth (the network's real-world value or utility).
    A currency token can only appreciate organically and constantly when there is growing demand due to the utility it offers.
    Most blockchain projects have failed to reach mass adoption because they haven't demonstrated an alternative to the organizational and financial operating models of all the important internet applications currently defining most of what the internet is.
    They haven't fulfilled the goal of upgrading how the human species communicates, interacts, and most importantly they have not done anything to fix the financial inequality.
    The great promise of blockchain technology is yet to be delivered.
    GRAT is here to speed up the process and show everyone what is possible from now on.

        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading" style="text-transform: initial;">More technical details about BiiP</h2>
    BiiP (Biospheric Identity Internet Protocol) is firstly an Open-Source API (Application Programming Interface), a revolutionary Online Authentication method using a decentralized identity running on a fast & secure blockchain.
    <b>Let's explain it in more common terms and in chronological order:</b>
    1. WhatsApp was the first to use GSM numbers instead of emails to register/authenticate people. But you can be sure that in 10 years, SIM cards will be a thing of the past just as audio cassettes were.
    2. Companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google have copied the original idea of general online authentication and transformed it into corporate OAuth (Online Authentication) which is centralized, private, and sadly, a corrupt version of the original OAuth 1.0 protocol that was conceivably a powerful Open-Source tool for registration and authentication to online services.
    3. Soon, GRAT will demonstrate a revolutionary protocol named BiiP using an open-source decentralized authentication API that harnesses the power of a fast, feeless crypto token (GRAT), creating a unique and extremely secure authentication method using blockchain address ownership confirmation as the proof of identity.

<b>BiiP & GRAT solve 3 hard 21<sup>st</sup>-century biospheric internet problems:</b>
    1.	<b>Biospheric Secure Authentication</b> - with built-in authorization of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> parties' access to personal information and funds, with no need for government managed KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.
    2.	<b>Biospheric Value Transfer System</b> - The token used for authentication is a GRAT address that together with BiiP allows you to authorize 3<sup>rd</sup> parties to make small transfers on your behalf for specific actions/events triggered by you and controlled by you. In essence, you become your own bank.
    3.	<b>Biospheric Exposure Services</b> - BiiP and GRAT token together can eliminate the need for advertising by providing a unique, platform-native, delegated 3<sup>rd</sup> party value transfer and instant crowdfunding ability to users.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  BiiP & GRAT enables and empowers better and universal exposure and funding/payment alternatives for important digital services like:
    Education, Health, Science, Crowdfunding, Finance, History and Data Banks, Search Engines, Apps, Ideas, Art, or Information in general.

    <b>The internet connected everyone and gave us unprecedented power and collective progress.
    But to ensure a free and progressive future for humanity it's not enough to be indirectly connected to it.

    We must understand and take back our digitally derived value from the hands of corporations and we must protect and own our identities, our real assets, and our virtual strength as a semi-virtual species, otherwise, the corporate networks that took over the internet will indirectly create a singularity, creating an A.I. that will instead own us.

    We don't want the Matrix movie to become real.</b>
    It's time to decentralize value and take back our freedom.

    <b>BiiP is a step in the right direction, the first of its kind just like Bitcoin was 14 years ago, it's a benevolent, virtual grassroots movement.</b>

    Similar to the way the IP (Internet Protocol) is basically a physical address or an address for a physical device/machine, BiiP basically represents a virtual address for a Biospheric Internet Identity that is created by a human, not a corporate entity.
    The BiiP biosphere network is built on top of the global IP network, this is why it's called a ‚Äúsecond layer technology‚Äù.

    Our BiiP implementation aims to transform the way we access digital services and understand their relationship with our physical reality.
    <!-- <b>Video coming soon in this place with me explaining BiiP and the straw man identity!</b> -->
    <!-- Make video here: hold my ID card and talk about it, talk about the laws and how I do not own the document, I am only a forced carrier for the number, just like live stock are numbered. -->

    This "Identity" Card represents my Romanian corporate identity, also known as a <b>straw man</b>. It was issued by a government corporation and so it belongs to it, not to me. The national insurance number represents an asset/insurance for the Romanian corporation, not for me as a human.
    The information about my straw man and all other documents like it (starting with the birth certificate) is used by government corporations in different global markets to derive and create value for the leaders of the pyramid structure of the corporation, in my case Romania, so not for me, my family, my friends or my community. They accomplish this by falsely promising to take care of me in return. They promise rights, roads, medical services, etc.
    BiiP allows you to create a digital blockchain-based future-proof alternative to the straw man identity.
    No corporation will be able to control it. We believe in a Decentralized Identity / Information / Content / Resources - Operational Model which must follow an Inclusive-Open-Source formula, different from the old and exclusive ‚ÄúPatent-based and Profit-based Business Models‚Äù.

<h2 class="heading">What is a straw man?</h2>
    "Since a straw man is not a real person, they exist only within the environment they were created, such as the state.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  With this, anything a person does outside of the state (or environment in which the straw man was created), does not impact them in their personal life. Similarly, their personal choices cannot be dictated by the state.
    In 1933, the straw man began to benefit the government. When the United States filed for bankruptcy in 1933, the governors of the state promised to provide the necessary funds by using the assets that belonged to all people of the state. Unfortunately for the government, they were unable to use assets that existed outside the state's power, including private property. With this, the government devised a way to bridge the gap between the state and the people. This bridge was the straw man.
    To implement this, the government made it mandatory that all birth certificates be registered with the Department of Commerce, and that all names be documented in capital letters. Now, bound to the state from birth, it became the people's responsibility to even out the country's debt.
    Due to this system, the only way citizens can benefit from the country's services is through their straw man. Essentially, the straw man is a commercial entity acting as a transmitting utility, which is a method of transporting services to the people. These services are ultimately paid for by the straw man through things like paying taxes." - <a href="https://www.upcounsel.com/what-is-a-straw-man-in-legal-terms" target="_blank">Source</a>

<h3 class="heading">Your straw man is an artificial person</h3>
    "At the time of birth, each person is issued their own straw man, legally speaking. On a birth certificate, the name that appears is in all capital letters. This name is a person's legal name. However, people often write their name using a combination of lowercase and capital letters, which is, legally speaking, a separate entity.
    Even names appearing on official licenses, such as those issued for marriage, appear in all capital letters. Until the time that a person (name in lowercase letters) reclaims their straw man (the name in all capitals), the state owns the name, not the person." - <a href="https://www.upcounsel.com/what-is-a-straw-man-in-legal-terms" target="_blank">Source</a>
        </page>
        <page class="page">  BiiP and GRAT token can be used to remove barriers for Human-to-Human Interaction and redefine digital processes for everyone adhering to the new Biospheric Internet. Governmental or private corporations all use one tool to convince us of anything they desire, it's called <b>Advertising</b>.
    <b>Advertising is an obsolete method of Evaluation, Distribution, and Exposure, all based on emotional manipulation and psychological warfare.</b>

<h2 class="heading">Defining the BiiP standard</h2>
    Any project that will use the original BiiP or a custom BiiP fork for its objectives will have to meet the following requirements to be able to claim a valid implementation of BiiP:<span style="font-size: 90%">
    1.	A decentralized, secure API that ties all the following features together.
    2.	A decentralized, secure, fast, feeless, Non-PoW blockchain, for using the blockchain address as a unique user identifier.
    3.	An encrypted, decentralized, biospheric identity storage system managed through a native cryptocurrency/token address association. This means that as a user, I can create a blockchain-based account where I am the only one that can store, modify and govern my personal information (like name, sex, age, email, IM IDs, mobile numbers, current address, other personal documents), funds and other settings that I want, by authenticating with the correct cryptocurrency/token address and/or secret key.
    4.	The solution must allow anyone to implement its custom BiiP API on any website/app, allowing relevant visitors/users to easily register or log in using a project-specific and native crypto address and/or secret key.
    5.	The ability for all account holders to govern 3<sup>rd</sup> party access to their personal information and to their funds.
    6.	The ability for all account holders to authorize 3<sup>rd</sup> parties (websites and apps) to execute small or custom transactions on their behalf (obeying user-configured rules).
    7.	Protection against public exposure of the token address or any other personal info.</span>

<h2 class="heading">Gratitude (GRAT) token</h2>
    The first cryptocurrency to use BiiP is the GRATITUDE Token, a deflationary fast, secure, and feeless token.
    The Purpose of GRAT token is to facilitate better biosphere online services, it represents the fuel for the new bleeding-edge alternatives to all the important Internet Layer Applications which are currently defining most of what we call The Internet, thus transforming how the human species communicates, evaluates and interacts.
    Some of the GRAT tokens are reserved for promoting the projects that will create Real Use Cases to create demand, thus increasing the network's self-worth or the network's universal real-world value and utility.
    <b>GRATITUDE TOKEN will harness the power of Blockchain Technology to decentralize the financial/monetary value created, shared, and invested by users of any digital network. We are working on decentralizing the Value derived from our Digital Selves.</b>
    <b>create</b> ‚Äì bring (something) into existence.
    <b>ascribe</b> - regard a text, quotation, or work of art as being produced by or belonging to (a particular person or period).
    <b>invest</b> - provide or endow someone or something with (a particular quality or attribute).

    You now better understand that The Symbolic Representation of Subjective or Objective Value ascribed or attributed to the work of any individual on Earth must be distributed uniformly across all Humanity if, as an advanced sentient species we want to live in a paradigm of Collaboration & Joy instead of Competition & Greed.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">Blockchain protocols and use cases</h2>
    Since the first idea of an encrypted blockchain was popularized beginning in the year 2008 through the Bitcoin application, we have witnessed 2 main/popular protocols being used to emit a form of digital currency that we all know as cryptocurrency:
    <b>PoW</b> (Proof of Work) and <b>PoS</b> (Proof of Stake).
    PoW was the first completely decentralized algorithm or protocol associated with cryptocurrency and it's simply a way to securely and accurately determine the amount of investment an individual or company made to support the network of the Bitcoin software.
    Bitcoin was intended to become a decentralized currency that anyone can use anonymously & without identity verification.
    Although it probably seemed like a good idea, in the beginning, its expansion made us realize that the PoW protocol doesn't contribute to the well-being of the planet or society due to the power consumption issue.
    People invested time and money into this type of work in exchange for some amount of Bitcoin which is determined and released by the Bitcoin App algorithm as a reward for the computing power provided.
    This computing power comes from buying expensive hardware, space rental, and energy consumption‚Ä¶ all very expensive investments made in the hope that over time, the price of Bitcoin will appreciate and there will be a profit for the investment.
    But as Satoshi Nakamoto himself believed, I also believe that profit should not be the goal of any individual or society.
    The PoW Protocol was written in the core of the Bitcoin application with the intention to correctly reward those who invest time and money to assemble and maintain hardware and internet infrastructure 100% dedicated to validating and storing the operations or transactions of the Bitcoin application across all its decentralized network.
    A fair idea.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    However, the creator of Bitcoin did not anticipate that people will try to exploit this PoW algorithm for profit. This entire greed-based activity or ‚Äúmining‚Äù for cryptocurrency, in general, is wasting hardware and network infrastructure that could be used for good.
    Miners are simply the human part of a crude method for emitting units of cryptocurrency into circulation. The amount of cryptocurrency units that miners receive in their wallet address is the newly emitted coins.
    Miners can hold onto the currency long-term or sell it on exchanges, and so the coins sold on exchanges are new coins put into circulation.
    For Bitcoin, the code was written to limit the amount of Bitcoins that will ever be emitted to 21 million units of Bitcoin (which can be further divided into 100 million parts or sub-units, just like ‚Ç¨1 can be divided into 100 cents or pennies, but way more parts).
    The 21 million total monetary supply limit means that Bitcoin, as a monetary system is a deflationary monetary system. With a monetary system like this, inflation is technically and practically impossible.
    When the last Bitcoin will be mined/emitted (which is estimated to be somewhere around February 2140), the Bitcoin software will no longer emit Bitcoins and people will have to price fight over the total amount of Bitcoin in circulation.
    The showstopper problem with PoW is that it created sort of a "crypto mining rush" which created an electrical energy and hardware consumption worldwide problem, not to mention the whales that have enough bitcoins to crash the market if they ever sell too much too fast.
    If you sum up all the cryptocurrency projects that implemented PoW, their total amount of electrical power consumption would be that of the consumption of many countries combined. The Bitcoin network for example consumes more electrical power than Argentina.
    The <b>PoS</b> (Proof-of-Stake) algorithm is a solution for a more scalable blockchain with higher transaction throughput. The biggest benefit is the elimination of the electrical energy consumption problem.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    This type of protocol basically emits coins through people purchasing a PoS cryptocurrency to stake it.
    This is like holding your money in a bank used to be (when we actually gained value) or like purchasing company stocks. Over time, a certain interest or dividends coming from transaction fees are divided among investors.
    Basically, if you solve the security issue of a PoS monetary system, this would be a fairer system that doesn't harm life on the planet.
    These 2 algorithms or protocols (PoW and PoS) are the main ‚ÄúConsensus Protocols‚Äù that were used for cryptocurrency so far.
    We must be very careful with the main players here because, the main crypto projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and most other projects derived (forked) from their software are now manipulated by whales owning large percentages of the coins. These whales became some of the wealthiest people in the world by creating artificial price bubbles (Bull markets and Bear markets). They're ruining people's economies and increasing inequality.
    We have yet to see any well adopted Real World use case for a blockchain application other than a monetary system, but the GRAT token is coming.

<h2 class="heading">The time for revolution is Now</h2>
    The old centralized and private ‚ÄúADS EVERYWHERE‚Äù profit-based Business Model for digital platforms of any kind must end.
    The new open-source BiiP model is here.
    Any individual, company, or community developing a website or app can now support BiiP using GRAT tokens as a representation of Digital Monetary Value that can be used better than we ever used fiat money.

<h2 class="heading">The old Status Quo</h2>
    Nothing is free in a Surveillance Capitalist Society. We keep paying for online services with the most precious resources humanity has: <b>Attention</b>
        </page>
        <page class="page">or if you prefer: Time and Privacy.
    <b>What do we get in return?</b> We get poorer.
    Democracy requires privacy, and there's none within a Surveillance State.
    <h3 class="heading">3 questions arise:</h3>
    1. <b>What</b> are filter bubbles? - companies like Goggle and Fakebook have stopped giving you information as it naturally flows, which is chronologically and literally, so we are all stuck in their filter bubble. In other words, we are allowing them to curate everything we consume. We didn't pay attention while they pulled this trick on us.
    They have decided for us, that they will show us <b>only what they want</b> and they are not allowing us to discover the information that <b>We want, when We want it, how We want it.</b> Video below or here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ofWFx525s&ab_channel=TED" target="_blank">Beware online 'filter bubbles' | Eli Pariser</a>

    2. <b>Why</b> - do we waste so much Time in someone's corrupt, privately-owned social media bubble, when we know for a fact, it does not give back to us? Maybe it's because there was no real awesome alternative, so far.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    3. <b>When</b> - are we going to migrate to a more "biosphere oriented media"?
    You'll love this quote:
    <i>"Like the Roman Empire, social media will ultimately lose the faith of its followers because it has become too large and too unwieldy to control and regulate. People will eventually become sick of supporting a medium that provides the means for the worst of humanity to plan and perpetrate their foul deeds. The sadness of it all is that those who had the original idea and developed the platforms and software were quite clever enough to realize this and able to predict how it would be misused. Unfortunately, they couldn't see beyond the dollar signs in their eyes, once they realized how personal data could be harvested and mined to provide them with vast wealth. Now almost everyone sees it for what it is and gradually as more people become its victims, it will gradually die."</i> - Nigel Furness (Musician, thinker, author)
    
    Do you see the problem? The üî∫ Surveillance Capitalism Pyramid Model of Digital Human Interaction is the problem.
    Their entire business is about mining the data of your life.
    With this hierarchical model, 1% of the world population extracts most of the collective value and as you go towards the bottom of the pyramid, the rest of the billions of users get almost none of it.
    Are we really going to ignore this and go back to interacting with their malevolent platforms the next second after reading this? (Unless it's for sharing our website or related content, then by all means, DO Create Awareness!).

<h2 class="heading">The opportunity</h2>
    Essentially, we are heading towards the beginning of a üåè Worldwide Digital Revolution which is happening ‚è∞ Right Now. Approximately 10 corporations own all of the internet and mass media. Together we will end this üî∫ Pyramid Scheme that has been going on for far too long.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    In this pyramid game, a few become billionaires and the users become miserably addicted to their masterfully designed <b>Echo Chambers</b>, remaining poor and ignorant.
    These ‚ÄúElite‚Äù consciously design software that consumes hours in your day and years in your life and this is possible because you essentially give away all those tens of thousands of hours throughout your life, for free.

<h2 class="heading">But what if we can choose better?</h2>
    We live in a world of creation and consumption where we can all be both creators and consumers, but our üåç collective biospheric wisdom and power come from sharing, not hoarding.
    The owners of the current technologies and of the most popular digital platforms are hoarders, they don't care about the users, on the contrary, they regard us as animals on a farm.
    We must go back to the drawing table, starting with the basics:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>create</th>
        <th>consume</th>
        <th>invest in</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Content/Assets</td>
        <td>Content/Assets</td>
        <td>Content/Assets</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    We can think of a better üåê Model for apps/websites like social media, where all users can benefit from the network, where nobody gets left behind. Enough with the 1% vs 99% game, let's even things out!

<h2 class="heading">Let's give Gratitude a chance</h2>
    Why is this the most powerful solution to restore the beautiful side of humanity in our world? Keep reading.
    Dear brothers and sisters, friends, we can lift ourselves up! Our exchange of information and creativity should not be a vanity or profit-oriented zero-sum game, because that is the result of greed and mania, it is mass psychosis and mass egomania. Gratitude is the cure.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    We can use the BiiP model and the GRAT token to allow for the flow of digital content / real-world value in any digital market or network to be shared uniformly and organically across itself.
    We regard it as üåç real-time global gratitude energy which should be equally and uniformly flowing, nourishing us all to our highest human potential. Currently, it is being siphoned (for the lack of a better word) by psychopaths or sociopaths and the whole world is suffering because of them. <b>It's our turn to grow and prosper!</b> Their game will soon be over.

<h2 class="heading">The Gratitude account</h2>
    <b>What sets the GRAT account apart from other similar dapp protocols?</b>
    The GRAT account is not just a way to connect to a wallet or dapp, it's a decentralized encrypted database of personal information attached or associated with an encrypted GRAT address, all stored safely on the blockchain.
    A GRAT protocol account is made from 3 main components:
    1. <b>A closed-end token address</b> - This is an encrypted <b>GRAT address + a username</b> stored in a decentralized blockchain file storage system. Only the owner, the GRAT system, and 3<sup>rd</sup> parties authorized by the owner (to some extent but with limitations) can execute transactions for this address. Nobody else can see the GRAT address keys for this address except the owner by signing the operation using his wallet app, the keys are not exposed to any other end.
    2. <b>Personal Information</b> like Names, Emails, Addresses, Social Security numbers, and other crypto account addresses. Just like the GRAT address, this information is encrypted and stored on decentralized nodes around the world. Only the GRAT system can with the permission of the account owner share this information (only once on registration) with 3<sup>rd</sup> parties.
    The owner of the account can authorize 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps/services upon registration to have access only to the personal information of his choice.
        </page>
        <page class="page">   3. <b>An API</b> (Application Programming Interface) that allows GRAT account owners to authorize and govern access for 3<sup>rd</sup> party website/apps/games to their personal information and finances or funds. In other words, besides the personal information shared on registration, the features in this component allow the account owner to govern 3<sup>rd</sup> party abilities to execute custom GRAT transactions on behalf of him/her for different actions/events triggered on 3<sup>rd</sup> party platforms/apps (actions like transferring, reacting, sharing, investing, funding or donating custom amounts of GRAT tokens).
    <b>You (the account owner) are the only one able to govern your information. The GRAT team can only see the information you authorize it to see. For example, this could be just a simple username, that's it.</b>
    Nobody except the owner and 3<sup>rd</sup> party websites/apps authorized by the owner can run operations on the GRAT account and the settings for authorized 3<sup>rd</sup> parties can be changed at any time in the GRAT account.
    <b>Only the owner of the account can ever access these settings, so it is crucial that the keys to the account are stored safely by its owner.</b>
    BiiP does not have a way to expose the keys directly to any other party.
    The GRAT account owner is the only human that can see the address keys by signing the operation from his crypto wallet.
    Once authenticated in the GRAT account (on <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a>), you now have the ability to update any field containing your personal information and customize transaction amounts and limits for different actions for all the authorized 3<sup>rd</sup> parties.
    All the critical information (GRAT address keys and Personal Information) is highly encrypted and stored on a file storage blockchain - on computers and servers around the world that don't know each other.
    Nobody except you has access to this information and you are the only one who can change it by using your wallet app to confirm you are the owner of the GRAT address.
        </page>
        <page class="page">   None of the Personal Information fields are ‚ÄúRequired‚Äù to pass validation of any GRAT account update and you may update the information at any time you like by authenticating to the decentralized GRAT account with your GRAT address.
    Now, let's take a minute to consider a very big difference between other online authentication methods like OAuth for example, and GRAT protocol (our BiiP implementation):
    Any time you want to register to a website or app that implemented the GRAT authentication method, you can choose precisely each piece of information that you want to share with that website.
    This is different than OAuth and other authentication protocols where the website or app is the one that specifies or requests personal information from you and the only option you have is to accept or the registration process will fail. Crazy I know.
    But with GRAT launched, we now have a unique way of registering, with your selected encrypted personal info, associated with your GRAT address, while enjoying a unique way of rewarding interactions on websites and apps and while being able to crowdfund anything, anywhere. All are available to users at the click/touch of a button.
    It's very hard to make technology simpler to use than this.

<h2 class="heading">Tokenomics</h2>
    The token is deflationary as it was created with a Max Supply of <b>12.000.000.000</b> GRAT tokens with 18 decimal points.
    There will be no built-in ability to block, recall or emit more tokens.
    <b>11 billion</b> tokens - will be distributed through a years long airdrop campaign, through Genesis signups and referrals.
    <b>900 million</b> tokens - are reserved for Genesis and SHIELD development (<b>800 million</b> tokens for Genesis initiatives and <b>100 million</b> for SHIELD).
    <b>100 million</b> tokens - will be distributed publicly through an IDO.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    These first IDO tokens offered will be at the price of 1‚Ç¨ / token over the course of at least 12 months.
    The funds raised from the IDO will be used as critical insurance for everyone, we will create liquidity pools, setting a base price for GRAT tokens. The IDO tokens will be distributed over time through at least one DEX (Decentralized Exchange), preventing the price to go lower than 1‚Ç¨ / GRAT token during the critical early months of market activity.
    Other exchanges may be targeted for listing after that to increase the demand for GRAT so that we can slowly offer the tokens reserved for research and creating awareness, to pay for recruiting Top Global Talent, and of course to develop all initiatives further.
    Our ambitious projects require a lot of resources, and volunteers, but also paid developers, all working on different projects and initiatives that are a huge challenge on their own and they all need support from the community of early adopters that will raise funds over time through the IDO.

<h2 class="heading">Adaptive IDO (Initial DEX Offering)</h2>
    Each month 8.333.333 tokens from the 100 million tokens IDO fund will be transferred into the DEX liquidity pools.
    For any month with reports (tokens that were not acquired by investors), the reported tokens will be carried to the next month where we will only add a difference up to 8.333.333 tokens. This ensures a uniform distribution across time.
    This means that the IDO supply will not increase more than 8.333.333 GRAT tokens per month until all 100 million tokens are consumed by investors.
    This semi-automatic emission method is as adaptive as PoW (Proof of Work), but with the major difference, or should we say extra benefit that you don't have to invest in mining hardware/rent / power to issue new tokens. We don't want to harm the Biosphere when you can just invest or register to a Genesis project to get and hold GRAT tokens.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  Our simple yet effective strategy is enough to avoid allowing "whales" to gobble up most of the IDO supply and to avoid contributing to the already critical biosphere pollution problems. It's very important that we avoid chemical emissions that would have happened with a mining algorithm for minting/emitting the tokens.
    The GRAT token price will appreciate organically over time, especially due to the demand that Genesis projects will create for the tokens.
    The number 12 billion was calculated on the basis of an <b>11 billion</b> people Max Human Population, a maximum theoretically possible on our current üåè Earth - according to the best current Earth math and statistics, as you can see in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LyzBoHo5EI" target="_blank">Why the world population won't exceed 11 billion</a>
    <b>+ 1 extra billion</b> reserved for development and for the critical IDO.

    The extra tokens represent a development and insurance fund that will help us further develop <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> projects and create awareness. Every decision to sell development fund tokens or list GRAT on a new exchange will have to pass voting through SHIELD.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    A few feeless blockchains are being tested for one winner to be chosen as the initial technological solution for the GRAT token. We will keep updating you about the evolution of this phase.
    The GRAT founders have reserved 0 tokens for themselves. Founders have to purchase tokens as well. We rely on our community and the development fund (from the IDO) for the support and growth of the <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a> project. Rewards will be given from this fund to collaborators based on contribution.

<img class="fullWidth" src="/white-paper/img/genesis.jpg" alt="genesis logo" loading="lazy"/>








    <b>GENESIS ÂÖÉ</b> - Means beginning. In our case, the beginning of the shift to the Biospheric Consciousness Digital Internet.
    Inspired by the infinite torus, the name and logo represent the umbrella of 8 chosen projects that will begin and lead the change towards the new Biospheric Internet era.
    800.000.000 GRAT tokens will be reserved for the development of 8 Genesis Initiatives voted on by GRATITUDE SHIELD, 100 million tokens for each project. These GRAT funds are necessary to attract talented developers, storytellers, communicators, and educators. Our mission is very ambitious and will require a lot of volunteers but also people who want to be rewarded for their work.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  In essence, this is a long term development investment for the <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> mission.
    The 100 million tokens reserved for each of the 8 Genesis projects will be used to pay for the costs of developing the technologies and platforms or apps, to reward the contributors in close partnership with the GRAT team and under strict, transparent community supervision, published and vetted firstly by GRATITUDE SHIELD.

<h2 class="heading">At the brink of a revolution</h2>
    Instead of allowing big corporations to exclusively reap all the financial value out of any network of people, we must allow the people to benefit from the value they created through their collective (thanks to everyone involved).
    We know that social media corporations, through manipulative dark pattern designs and spying on their users reap increasingly amounts of data from everyone. And so they use smart but unaware people and artificial intelligence to extract more and more value from that data of our lives and from creators of digital content.
    We never collectively noticed this, little due to nobody reading the Terms and Conditions, but mostly because there was no real alternative so far that could really have a chance to win us over.
    Over the years these corporations siphoned incredible wealth from the people, concentrating it in the hands of a few individuals. This created abominable wealth inequality. Because they use censorship, the platforms/apps became Orwellian tools to manipulate the opinion and direction of society, but censorship is the end of any society.
    <b>We must STOP allowing for our data and thoughts to be siphoned and silenced, we must let them create value for their creators and supporters.</b>
    The financial and cultural value must remain in the people's hands if we are ever to achieve anything close to some sense of equality of opportunity and progressive education in Earth's societies.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  Humanity must transition from a centralized pyramid model of value flow (where 1% has more financial power than the rest of the 99%) to a Decentralized Network Biosphere Model where all points are equal and everyone is empowered equally. Collective wisdom > Individual wisdom.
<h3 class="heading">Emission Method</h3>
    Usage = Demand = Organic growth. The value of GRAT tokens will organically grow due to the development of Genesis projects where we are distributing most of the supply (11 billion tokens) over years through airdrops for registration and for referring.
    Developers, companies, and private persons will need more GRAT tokens to be able to participate in the new generation of platforms and apps.
    So, basically, users will receive small amounts of GRAT tokens just for registering to Genesis platforms where they can begin to experience the new biosphere value flow. Getting some free tokens is important, especially for people who can't afford to invest, but who can create awareness.
<h3 class="heading">A biosphere media, not "social media"</h3>
    Surveillance "social media" as we know it has taken over the internet (so far) and it's difficult to step outside the matrix they've created. Can you imagine the internet without it now? If you can, you already understand our vision! We are grateful!
    You probably experienced by now that the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù part of social media is not really social. After spending time there, did it really make you feel like you socialized? Did you make new authentic connections? Did you become a better human persona? Probably not.
<h3 class="heading">The echo chamber effect</h3>
    "The echo chamber effect occurs online when a harmonious group of people amalgamate and develop tunnel vision. Participants in online discussions may find their opinions constantly echoed back to them, which reinforces their individual belief systems due to the declining exposure to other's opinions."
        </page>
        <page class="page">    Corporate media does not promote the progress of our species, not just because of the echo chamber effect, the problem runs deep.
    Truth be told, studies have shown that most people feel lonely, anxious, angry and depressed while and after ‚Äúsocializing‚Äù in today's social media.
    We probably all wondered at one point why a better platform isn't taking over Facebook yet. Censorship is now at a nazi level there, information feeds are manipulated into a personal information prison (exactly as they want it) ‚Äì a bubble.
    They spy on us, they treat us like cattle, and we do what? We keep using their dis-service.
    But consciousness is expanding, slowly but surely we realize that maybe all we have to DO is to imagine a better digital media, a Biosphere Media if you will and exclude the word ‚Äúsocial‚Äù from a digital platform that is never going to replace real human socialization.
    <b>All Together, we are waking up to this transition and we need you!</b>
    This is one of the most important Genesis initiative out of the 8 and it's already in development. We are talking about a Decentralized Biosphere Consciousness Media platform. It's the next generation of human media that does not use advertising for revenue.
    It's built by you, me, everyone and it is hosted on many computers and servers around the biosphere belonging to people that don't know each other. Blockchain allows us to do this now. We live in incredible times, let's be aware of this and not lose any more time in echo chambers, in information prisons!
    <b>How do you become a user?</b> All you need to do is create a GRAT account on <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a>, it's very fast. Then, with just your new GRAT address and a chosen username you can create or extend a BiiP link for <b>biosphere.media</b>. You can do this on any website / app / device that uses BiiP technology.
    <b>That's it! No SMS, No Email, No KYC (corporate identity verification), simple and for everyone.</b>
        </page>
        <page class="page">  <h2 class="heading">The fun begins</h2>
    Now, as a user here, you can do all the important stuff you can do now on social media, without government identity verification or fiat payment services and without advertising.
    As a user here, you will never see an ad. All users are equal and there are no special pages or statuses, we are all equal and it doesn't matter if we are individuals or companies.
    As a user here, imagine you are just scrolling or swiping like usually through your feed, then you stop at a post you like, and you click on share. Because of this, you receive an instant transfer of GRAT tokens worth ~ ‚Ç¨1 or even ~ 5‚Ç¨ because you have around 5000 active friends that can bring exposure to the author.
    The post author is conscious of this mechanism as he/she set the amount himself/herself, to show appreciation or gratitude to the person who brings them exposure/attention to their content (the amounts mentioned are just hypothetical examples).
    Or, as a user here, you arrive at a post you like, and of course, you feel the need to react by pressing a reaction button. In the background, an automatic instant transfer of GRAT tokens worth ~ ‚Ç¨1 from your wallet to the original author of the post is executed.
    You are conscious of this mechanism as you set the amount yourself to show your appreciation or gratitude by donating it to the author of the post (the amounts mentioned are just hypothetical examples).

    <b>All this is done at the click/touch of a button. That's it!
    Instant exposure and crowdfunding for all users.
    No more ads!
    Now we can enjoy our life better and faster.
    We can raise millions in hours and impact the world naturally.
    Organic and efficient progress for humanity is now possible.</b>
        </page>
        <page class="page">  The platform/software will be developed and maintained by volunteering and paid developers in the beginning years, by early investors that raised the development fund, and by SHIELD members that participate in the vetting and voting of all members, issues, and proposals.
    There is no profit for them except, fairly from the early investment they are making with their time/currency. We eliminated the need to show ads on the platform, ever.
    So, in essence, as a user registered on the new platform you can empower others by sending them GRAT tokens or you can earn a living by bringing others exposure to their content and receiving GRAT tokens for it (no matter what type of content it is, links, images, videos, etc.).

<h4 class="heading">3 simple roles with a GRATITUDE twist</h4>
    <b>‚Ä¢ Creator of Content</b> - No matter if it's writing words, creating images, videos, services, etc. - Creators need other people to recognize their work, appreciate it, and even invest/purchase those creations. This can be done by allowing creators of content to receive GRAT tokens automatically in their wallet which come from the wallet of any Consumer (user) that likes or interacts with their content (the amount can be customizable only by the Consumer).
    <b>‚Ä¢ Consumer of Content</b> - As a consumer, you don't have to just give away your attention for free, you can share the work of Creators and because this action benefits the Creator more than the Consumer, a number of GRAT tokens can be sent from the Creator wallet to the Consumer wallet that shared his/hers content, this replaces advertising and is basically offering exposure to the work of the Creator (this benefits everyone and offers an incentive for stimulating information flow; the amount can be customizable only by the Creator, the bigger the amount the more exposure and visibility).
    <b>‚Ä¢ Investor in GRAT</b> - As an investor, you acquire and hold GRAT tokens and by doing so, you will be able to firstly, provide some liquidity that will be used for the development and awareness of <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a>.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  So, you are appreciating the value of GRAT versus other forms of currencies/assets and you are motivating people and companies to engage with GRAT for the development of digital markets like websites and apps or become their users.
    In this way, people can enter the Gratitude Biosphere Consciousness Network transition where we all thrive together.
    After you've accumulated some GRAT tokens, you can swap them into any other currency and spend them on anything you want in the digital or real world, but we don't recommend being impatient and panic-sell before its value has appreciated over the months or years.
    As we discussed, on a media platform using the GRAT protocol and token, if your simple üëç Like ‚Äì would represent an instant value transfer in GRAT tokens that is estimated somewhere around the equivalent of ‚Ç¨1, would you give it away to just any post? Of course not. This creates a more honest and valuable interaction between users.
    Together, we can create a digital, open-source, free-to-use, transparent, deflationary, decentralized, inclusive, biosphere media - where all its users prosper from interacting with each other using better human participation and human interaction models.
    Our attention should not be invested in a corrupt medium, a censored form of communication for our digital avatars locked inside echo chambers created by algorithms.
    These tech giants siphon away your time and hard work for almost nothing given in return.
    Haven't you noticed how the quality of your life decreases dramatically the more you spend it on social media? How can this be a good thing? You waste time and lose financial value or stability, you gain anxiety and depression.
    All the life that you have is taxed by these corrupt companies through your interactions with their platforms/apps, by sharing your tastes, your preferences, your personal information, basically all your free data and information input.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  You're sharing your thinking, your art, your knowledge, everything you do is monitored and controlled by them and you pay them to do it with your time and health.
    When you're consuming information and content from other users, besides the fact that up to 50% of the content is now advertising, the remaining 50% is fed to you according to what their algorithms think you should consume. You have no choice in this anymore, it's their way or the highway. This is called being trapped in an echo chamber.
    When we are trapped in their egomaniacal designed echo chambers our life goals are left behind, we are sacrificing our dream life for nothing.
    You look at young people walking down the street and you see them constantly looking at their mobile screens. When do they have time to see a leaf moving in the wind? When do they have time to stare at the stars at night? It seems that mankind has entered an age of technology worshipping, where man doesn't use technology anymore, technology uses him. He lives in the illusion that he's talking to the whole world on his computer screen, but in fact, he's alone.
    If we do not use technology to change this towards our benefit again, we are headed for an age of corporate A.I. that can possibly lead to an Orwellian society or worse, to our extinction.

<h2 class="heading">Massive scale online collaboration</h2>
    Let's get a clearer picture of how much time humanity is spending for example on Facebook and getting nothing back while facebook reaps billions off of people advertising on their platform.
    Studies have shown that the average user spends 18 hours per month on Facebook. This increased during the so-called covid plandemic to 65 minutes per day or 32.5 hours per month.
    Source: <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7863/social-media-use-during-coronavirus-covid-19-worldwide/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/topics/7863/social-media-use-during-coronavirus-covid-19-worldwide/#dossierKeyfigures</a>
        </page>
        <page class="page">  65	minutes per day on average multiplied by around 3 billion constantly active users means:
&#10003;	3.25 billion hours spent by Facebook users daily on its platform or app
&#10003;	that's over 135.4 million days spent collectively on Facebook, every day
&#10003;	that's 371.000 years daily that could be used to explore the universe
&#10003;	3710 centuries that our species is mostly wasting every day

    The entire world is collectively wasting incomprehensible amounts of time in these ads-ridden echo chambers, time that could be used to empower ourselves and accelerate human progress. Ergo, the entire world works for the big social media companies, every day, for free, while they make billions from our work and personal information.
    <b>It's Time to change this!</b>
    Just look at what this one dude named Luis von Ahn (early developer of captcha script for human user validation) accomplished with only 10 seconds occasionally spent by a few million different users around the world doing the same thing as before (filling captchas, but with a twist). The video below or here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ht4qiDRZE8" target="_blank">Massive-scale online collaboration | Luis von Ahn</a>

        <page class="page">  He leveraged just 10 seconds of collective time spent by a few million people daily to create extremely powerful tools for the benefit of all humans at no cost to individuals. Imagine what we could do with a few minutes every day spent by 3 billion users in an intelligent way that helps us solve unbelievably hard biosphere problems.
    If Facebook and other social media platforms/apps would not be running ads, they would go bankrupt before you can say ‚ÄúWebsite under maintenance‚Äù. If these businesses and in general, if people would have any better option other than ads to get exposure, they would go for it. Giants fall in time too, just like the cassette and CD industry ended when the mp3 technology took off.
    As we already established, the current business model for social media companies is to monetize user activity through their Ads. In this rigged game, the users and business owners always lose more than they gain. Humanity loses more than it gains. We lose more than we can imagine.
    We, the founders of <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> believe that the value invested by humans (time or money) in a network of any kind must remain in the network and everyone must have equality of opportunity to implicitly benefit from their hard work without intermediaries, without doing more work to create campaigns and then paying the platforms/apps owners huge amounts of hard-earned currency only to get bad exposure.

<h2 class="heading">Beyond advertising</h2>
    <b>No profit schemes. No monopoly. No pyramid schemes.
    Just Open-Source Freedom</b>
    GRAT stands for a fair participation and interaction model manifested through one single unifying truth, the truth of a üåè Biosphere Consciousness where all things are inclusive.
    Without exploiting our lives for profit, ‚Äúbig players‚Äù like bankers, social media corporations, and other types of services will have to join us or face extinction.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    We can transition from a üî∫ Hierarchical Pyramid System centered on Profit and Exclusivity - to a üåè Biosphere Consciousness Network centered on contribution and inclusivity.
    This new approach can uniformly distribute the results of the daily creative energy spent by humanity, it will transfer for example the users of social media to a better Biosphere Media, part of the Gratitude Biospheric Internet where apps and websites are run by Gratitude Energy instead of greed, espionage, false information and fake fame.
    On <b>biosphere.media</b>, this process will be transparent for both Creators and Consumers, which naturally you can be both at the same time.
    <b>‚Ä¢ As a Consumer</b> you can choose an automatic amount given away for every interaction with content created by others, or manually send tokens in one click/touch.
    <b>‚Ä¢ As a Creator</b> you can choose an automatic amount of GRAT to give to users sharing your content with others, the more generous, the more exposure you get.
        In both examples, GRAT is automatically transferred to the users' wallets without any human intermediary (bank) approving the transactions, all 24/7.

<h3 class="heading">The GRAT operational model for biosphere.media</h3>
    By using the GRAT protocol in a social media app/platform, one simple ‚ÄúLike‚Äù can automatically send a small, custom GRAT token amount to the post author (source of the post) as a Token of Gratitude which is worth something in any currency (you can exchange the tokens for any currency, even fiat). In this way, the interaction was made valuable for both parties and the author is motivated to keep creating quality content that is evaluated and appreciated by humans, not by algorithms and their owners.
    The same model is perfect also in the case of other people or businesses who want the same thing (exposure), but with different goals like Communication, Digital Content, Crowd Funding, Brand Building, User Conversions, Purchases, Exposure in general.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h3 class="heading">Natural monetization and exposure</h3>
    Our exposure/reward model is based on a digital ‚Äúword of mouth effect‚Äù achieved naturally and organically, without bothering to create and manage any ad campaigns that most of the time fail to serve the clients to get more value from their business/idea. <b>You are free to focus on creation!</b>
    By using our model for a biosphere media platform/app instead of the old ‚Äúads monetization‚Äù model, the interaction with the content created by the users will evolve organically and the value created and shared by the entire network will increase and flow organically across all dimensions of human activity associated with or invested in such a network.
    In other words, your reactions can send GRAT tokens to authors, and sharing posts can send you GRAT tokens from the author.
    Of course, for sharing of content, criteria like the number of friends and their level of activity in the last month are measured, also if users have actually seen the post shared.  The user who shares something is the one receiving GRAT tokens from the source (original author of the post).
    As with any exposure we seek, we must compensate those who do the exposure for us, so as an author we should share some of the benefits we get from our exposure, we can give back to the community that grows naturally, without any need for psychological warfare (ads) which are costly manipulative designs using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait" target="_blank"><b>click bait</b></a> or <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/" target="_blank"><b>dark pattern design</b></a> to trick you.
    For Reaction and Share actions, GRAT tokens will be consumed automatically from your GRAT Protocol address as users interact with each other's posts.
    If you run out of GRAT tokens you just need to share more content for others to get some or exchange some fiat currency for GRAT tokens and then transfer them to your GRAT Protocol address.
    And, if you don't have a required minimum amount for each of the 2 actions (Reaction or Sharing), the action will still be successful, but the system will change the visibility of the post automatically so that it'll have a lower priority over other posts.
        </page>
        <page class="page">    We also believe there is no point in gathering and analyzing huge amounts of personal information from users to get exposure only for certain users that matched certain keywords.
    This is another mistake that internet tech corporations like Facebook, Google, and others make, which is to trick clients into believing that they have extraordinary control over their campaigns (the ability to tweak keywords and other information). <b>They let you play an expensive game with poor results</b>.
    Our goal is to leave the decision to act on information to the users and then build from that. There is absolutely no conversion guarantee in targeting people that liked a specific page related to your activity/business and especially no guarantee for showing ads to people that said a certain keyword in a text or verbal conversation.
    <b>Ad targeting is a very bad excuse for spying on users</b>.
    Our operational model is fully natural and automatic, it keeps the tokens inside the network and creates organic natural movement of financial value and exposure for people and businesses. It creates a true <b>free exposure market</b> based on appreciation and gratitude, as opposed to an advertising market where clients use psychological warfare, running campaigns that are not worth the money, based on privacy-less models of business developed from data greedily gathered by constantly spying on people to extract irrelevant out-of-context information.
    <b>The advertisement era of humanity is fading away slowly but surely</b>.

<img class="fullWidth stickBottom" src="/white-paper/img/shield.jpg" alt="SHIELD logo" loading="lazy" />
        </page>
        <page class="page">  <b>SHIELD Áõæ</b> - Represents protection through the wisdom of the crowds, the more shield members, the better decisions can be taken for any mission, any cause, and overall for any important project objectives.
    To understand why SHIELD is powerful, I recommend one of my favorite books of all time: <b>The wisdom of crowds</b> by James Surowiecki.

    SHIELD serves as a powerful open-source NPPoS (Non-Profit Proof of Stake) vetting and voting tool. It's currently being developed as web-based software.
    <b>GRATITUDE SHIELD</b> is powered by the Gratitude Token (GRAT).
    <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> is protected by SHIELD, a powerful open-source democracy which is based on Truth and Value.
    We are demonstrating its utility for the first time on the <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> website where it serves as a public platform allowing humans to stake GRAT tokens to become members and get involved in the development of all <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> projects, including GENESIS projects.
    SHIELD members collectively act as a non-profit PoS (Proof of Stake) committee and although all issues and proposals are public only members can raise issues or post proposals and vote on them, depending on the type of membership staking for.
    SHIELD offers Leaderless Collective Protection and crowd-intelligent decision-making mechanisms. It's simply a great tool for nurturing progress that could never be accomplished through private-centralized teams or companies which are most of the time executing their roles with low capacity or interest. They do it for the money or power/control, not for the mission.
    Anyone can fork the open-source code and develop the tool further for their own mission.
    To engage with the GRATITUDE SHIELD platform, you must register and be logged in to your GRAT account at: <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a>.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">How does it work?</h2>

    We do not allow anyone to become a member without first making sure they aren't a bot (software) and that they're well-intended.
    All new members are vetted through SHIELD and members can be voted out if needed, their staked tokens being returned.

<h3 class="heading">Issues and Proposals</h3>
    A 60% or more collective consensus is required for an issue or proposal to be valid and pass.
    When a Visionary member raises an issue or posts a proposal, all members can start voting.
    If the issue is not urgent, after 1 month the issue or proposal expires and the results of the votes are automatically calculated by the system.
    This is not a perfect system as humans are still needed to fix any issue and develop or implement any proposal to the code. Therefore, as with any tool like this, the <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> team has the right to reject a result for an issue or proposal for technical or logical reasons that will be attached to the public issue or proposal, so everyone can see.
    For the same reasons, in the beginning, the team can accept issues or proposals even if they have under 60% consensus.
    That being said, we will strive to improve the membership and voting mechanism so that we get as close as possible to a feasible and sustainable solution for transparent-open-sourced democracy (not like the corrupt fake democratic system we have today).
    SHIELD is 100% transparent, it's a very powerful decision-making tool for all communities, companies, and countries to use.
    The process behind SHIELD will be 100% transparent and public, as it should be and as all true open-source communities should make their decisions.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">SHIELD membership types</h2>
    To become a member, you must stake a fixed amount of 1 GRAT token for GUARDIAN and 100 GRAT tokens for VISIONARY (this might change in the future).
    Memberships are not permanent; they have an expiration time for user inactivity of 1 month, and a total duration of 6 months for GUARDIANS, respectively 12 months for VISIONARIES (this might change too at launch and in the future).
    The staking cost of joining and the number of membership types can change in the future.
    All these decisions and many others will be voted on by SHIELD members.
    There are 2 types of memberships for the GRATITUDE SHIELD platform:
<img class="fullWidth" style="margin-top: 0.8em" src="/white-paper/img/shield-memberships.jpg" alt="shield memberships" loading="lazy"/>










    The Shield Visionary membership allows you to create a maximum of 3 issues or proposals once a month with an expiration date of 1 month.
    The tokens staked are automatically refunded after the membership expiration date.
    SHIELD memberships do not give out dividends or give any special benefits. Both memberships can be renewed at any time by depositing the minimum staking amount again.
        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">Early Days</h2>
    The effectiveness of the model/mechanism for raising issues, making proposals and voting depends on the number of initial members that are dedicated to the <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> mission. If we have enough members in the early days, the operational model can be developed faster as more voting power and staking equals a faster consensus and more awareness, but true democracy has never been achieved so far with any system. So we are realistic in this regard, but hopeful that we can do something good here no matter what the results will be.
    The difference will hopefully be made by the fact that SHIELD members have no financial benefits from being a member, being part of a democratic non-profit PoS participation system means they must be in it for the mission, for progress, not for profit, for gratitude, not for greed.
    <i><b>It is our greatest desire that over time, SHIELD membership types and features will be improved so that SHIELD will become better at its role and true democracy will hopefully one day be achieved and the whole world will use or implement a SHIELD open-source system to vote on their issues and proposals.</b></i>

<h2 class="heading">The end of surveillance capitalism</h2>
    We talked about a Biosphere Consciousness Internet and the new Gratitude technology that will do its part in the transition towards it.
    You can now see how internet technology and A.I. seems to be used to imprison us rather than free us. At <a href="/">gratitudetoken.world</a> we want to help solve this world problem.
    We envision solutions that can really change the wrong direction we are headed for. And I can't help but keep thinking that in our current paradigm of a Surveillance Capitalism World, we are ‚Äúsummoning the demon‚Äù as Elon Musk said it. DO we have time to change this? <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world/puzzle" target="_blank">Join us</a> and ask questions later!
        </page>
        <page class="page">  Billions of people are now being watched and recorded every second of every day through their smartphones, laptops, PCs, TVs, wearables, smart home devices, etc.
    Everything you say, type, and every micro-expression or movement you make is being constantly analyzed by A.I. to discover new ways to manipulate and extract value from you and your family, value that is transferred to the corporations developing the A.I. ignorantly, for profit, for greed.
    It's like there's already a core system somewhere that wants to understand human behavior better than any other human or group of humans ever could.
    Seems like technology has a mind of its own, but I believe that if we act now, we have time to avoid societal self-destruction by A.I. ‚Äì not like in the Terminator movies but like in the Elysium (2013) movie.
    <b>We need to educate ourselves about this. DO your part and inform your families, and your friends, discuss this subject. Time is running out.</b>
    Share our website and this White Paper with your family and friends, read everything together and watch the videos together and discuss the information and how it can impact everyone's life.
    <b>We need to change how we use the internet so that it won't use us.
    The internet was supposed to bring forth the age of enlightenment, to set our species free, so far it mostly imprisoned us.
    A tool must serve righteously and not be allowed to imprison the human spirit. Our collective creative energy will be freed</b>.

    You can act now and support the mission of <a href="https://gratitudetoken.world">gratitudetoken.world</a>. A simple sharing of our website is doing a lot for the mission.
    And when we succeed, we can once again as a species take back the power that was taken away from us by greed and ignorance.
    Maybe we can change our direction and maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe, we can go towards what Jason Silva explained in this video on the next page in symbiosis, not as slaves: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cITA2ysR4z0" target="_blank">The Six Epochs of Evolution</a>

        </page>
        <page class="page"><h2 class="heading">Curation and validation</h2>
    <b>We are planning for SHIELD to offer a decentralized transparent mechanism to curate Online Content as well</b>. Not like the corrupt and centralized, corporate-funded "fact-checkers" that Google, Facebook, Youtube, etc. - are using today.
    For example, Wikipedia is an extraordinary idea that was supposed to store all the knowledge of humankind. But it has a huge problem, the curating process is corrupt and it's centralized. Being a system with centralized code governed by a human organization means some people have many ways to access the information from the inside, through bribes, or by hacking the system. Anyone can make or modify a Wikipedia page and with enough curating power bought you can keep the information there until everyone else just gives up, thus turning lies into ‚Äútruth‚Äù for most people.
    When people try to correct false or inaccurate information on Wikipedia about science, famous people, politicians, billionaires, etc. - these corrupt individuals have the power to employ more ‚Äúcurators‚Äù to vote against that information and there is no vetting or protection mechanism that supports <b>truth</b> and <b>value</b> instead of greed and lies.
    In the last few years, Independent Fact Checkers and curating organizations have been given great power by big corporations like Google, Facebook, etc. But why? You see, their rise is far from honest and decent. Those given powers came at a great collective cost, resulting in centralized control of information and Nazi level censorship, we are outright lied to on important societal issues.
    You may have noticed that you can't post anything anymore that has the slightest nuance of reference to subjects they think are ‚ÄúNot OK to post‚Äù or that have the slightest feeling of revolt against the system. You may have noticed the reason they invoke for this is that we didn't follow their ‚ÄúCommunity Guidelines‚Äù which are not created and vetted by any community, it's written by them alone.
        </page>
        <page class="page">  You see, they use words like Community and Privacy and Freedom, but only to manipulate and deceive their users into thinking they actually have those rights and that they are protected. In reality, our data is far from being protected and all the information they feed us is carefully controlled by their algorithms in a way that we are always in the dark about the truly important matters of our time and of our species, matters of the entire Biosphere.
    Youtube and other platforms have the same issue for censoring and curating content, they would never allow true, transparent, and decentralized curating of their content because it does not fit with their advertising business model and their hidden business model of selling your personal data to other third parties.
    So, we must step in and fix this issue as well.
    It would seem that most problems we have today with services, especially digital online services always seem to adopt corrupt solutions that create more problems for the users, for the entire world.
    There are so many unanswered questions about the problems we face today. <b>Here are some of them:</b>
    Shouldn't we see some progress towards a better online world by now?
    Shouldn't online services accept all humans of any nationality anywhere in the world?
    Where are the solutions that include everyone?
    How do I know the information I am reading is true and/or properly checked?
    How is my personal data protected really?
    Why do I get only a fraction of the value from what I create?
    Why are we never asked to vote on important issues anywhere?
    What is the economy truly?
    Why are markets and economies so unstable?
    Why do we always have inflation?
    Why do I always work the same or more for less?
    Why are we being manipulated more and more by the top corporations and
        </page>
        <page class="page">governments instead of them becoming better organized and more transparent?
    Why do we keep buying into fear from fake news, fake science, and fake money?
    Why are we being fed only fear-based news and information everywhere? It's not like everyone in the world is just bad or evil, in fact, most people are good and well-intended.
    So many questions ‚Ä¶
